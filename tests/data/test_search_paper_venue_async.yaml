      Large-Scale Generative Language Model", "abstract": "Pretrained general-purpose
      language models can achieve state-of-the-art accuracies in various natural language
      processing domains by adapting to downstream tasks via zero-shot, few-shot and
      fine-tuning techniques. Because of their success, the size of these models has
      increased rapidly, requiring high-performance hardware, software, and algorithmic
      techniques to enable training such large models. As the result of a joint effort
      between Microsoft and NVIDIA, we present details on the training of the largest
      monolithic transformer based language model, Megatron-Turing NLG 530B (MT-NLG),
      with 530 billion parameters. In this paper, we first focus on the infrastructure
      as well as the 3D parallelism methodology used to train this model using DeepSpeed
      and Megatron. Next, we detail the training process, the design of our training
      corpus, and our data curation techniques, which we believe is a key ingredient
      to the success of the model. Finally, we discuss various evaluation results,
      as well as other interesting observations and new properties exhibited by MT-NLG.
      We demonstrate that MT-NLG achieves superior zero-, one-, and few-shot learning
      accuracies on several NLP benchmarks and establishes new state-of-the-art results.
      We believe that our contributions will help further the development of large-scale
      training infrastructures, large-scale language models, and natural language
      generations.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 78, "citationCount":

      arti\ufb01cial intelligence pro-poses that consciousness can be simulated by
      a Turing machine. This implies a potential theory of everything where the universe
      is a simulation on a computer, which begs the question of whether we can prove
      we exist in a simulation. In this work, we construct a relative model of computation
      where a computable local machine is simulated by a global , classical Turing
      machine. We show that the problem of the local machine computing simulation
      properties of its global simulator is undecidable in the same sense as the Halting
      problem. Then, we show that computing the time, space, or error accumulated
      by the global simulator are simulation properties and therefore are undecidable.
      These simulation properties give rise to special relativistic e\ufb00ects in
      the relative model which we use to construct a relative Church-Turing-Deutsch
      thesis where a global, classical Turing machine computes quantum mechanics for
      a local machine with the same constant-time local computational complexity as
      experienced in our universe.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2022, "referenceCount":

      In this paper, I challenge that assumption by providing strong mathematical
      arguments against the Church-Turing thesis. First, I show that there are decision
      problems that are computable for humans, but uncomputable for Turing Machines.
      Next, using a thought experiment I show that a humanoid robot equipped with
      a Turing Machine as the control unit cannot perform all humanly doable physical
      tasks. Finally, I show that a quantum mechanical computing device involving
      sequential quantum wave function collapse can compute sequences that are uncomputable

      to the conclusion that the human mind cannot be simulated by a Turing Machine.

      "The increasing sophistication of NLP models has renewed optimism regarding

      clarity in how \u2018understanding\u2019 is used in this and other disciplines
      have made it difficult to discern how close we actually are. A critical, interdisciplinary

      Beyond linguistic knowledge, this requires considering our species-specific
      capabilities to categorize, memorize, label and communicate our (sufficiently
      similar) embodied and situated experiences. Moreover, gauging the practical
      constraints requires critically analyzing the technical capabilities of current
      models, as well as deeper philosophical reflection on theoretical possibilities

      cognitive-linguistic, and technical\u2014to unpack the challenges involved in
      approaching true (human-like) language understanding. By unpacking the theoretical

      artificial intelligence (XAI) is to improve the trust relationship in human-AI
      interaction. One assumption underlying research in transparent AI systems is
      that explanations help to better assess predictions of machine learning (ML)
      models, for instance by enabling humans to identify wrong predictions more efficiently.
      Recent empirical evidence however shows that explanations can have the opposite
      effect: When presenting explanations of ML predictions humans often tend to
      trust ML predictions even when these are wrong. Experimental evidence suggests
      that this effect can be attributed to how intuitive, or human, an AI or explanation
      appears. This effect challenges the very goal of XAI and implies that responsible
      usage of transparent AI methods has to consider the ability of humans to distinguish
      machine generated from human explanations. Here we propose a quantitative metric
      for XAI methods based on Turing''s imitation game, a Turing Test for Transparency.
      A human interrogator is asked to judge whether an explanation was generated
      by a human or by an XAI method. Explanations of XAI methods that can not be
      detected by humans above chance performance in this binary classification task
      are passing the test. Detecting such explanations is a requirement for assessing
      and calibrating the trust relationship in human-AI interaction. We present experimental
      results on a crowd-sourced text classification task demonstrating that even

      "title": "Polynomial Turing Kernels for Clique with an Optimal Number of Queries",
      "abstract": "A polynomial Turing kernel for some parameterized problem P is
      a polynomial-time algorithm that solves P using queries to an oracle of P whose
      sizes are upper-bounded by some polynomial in the parameter. Here the term \u201cpolynomial\u201d
      refers to the bound on the query sizes, as the running time of any kernel is
      required to be polynomial. One of the most important open goals in parameterized
      complexity is to understand the applicability and limitations of polynomial
      Turing Kernels. As any fixed-parameter tractable problem admits a Turing kernel
      of some size, the focus has mostly being on determining which problems admit
      such kernels whose query sizes can be indeed bounded by some polynomial. In
      this paper we take a different approach, and instead focus on the number of
      queries that a Turing kernel uses, assuming it is restricted to using only polynomial
      sized queries. Our study focuses on one the main problems studied in parameterized
      complexity, the Clique problem: Given a graph G and an integer k, determine
      whether there are k pairwise adjacent vertices in G. We show that Clique parameterized
      by several structural parameters exhibits the following phenomena: \u2022 It
      admits polynomial Turing kernels which use a sublinear number of queries, namely
      O(n/ log(n)) queries where n is the total size of the graph and c is any constant.
      This holds even for a very restrictive type of Turing kernels which we call
      OR-kernels. \u2022 It does not admit polynomial Turing kernels which use O(n)
      queries, unless NP \u2286 coNP / poly. For proving the second item above, we
      develop a new framework for bounding the number of queries needed by polynomial
      Turing kernels. This framework is inspired by the standard lower bounds framework
      for Karp kernels, and while it is quite similar, it still requires some novel
      ideas to allow its extension to the Turing setting.", "venue": "arXiv.org",

      "abstract": "It is well known that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) faced limitations

      representation which inherently preserves the spatial structure of data and
      has the potential to provide better memory structures when compared to canonical
      neural networks that use vector representation. Neural Turing machines (NTMs)
      are novel RNNs that implement notion of programmable computers with neural network
      controllers to feature algorithms that have copying, sorting, and associative
      recall tasks. In this paper, we study augmentation of memory capacity with matrix
      representation of RNNs and NTMs (MatNTMs). We investigate if matrix representation
      has a better memory capacity than the vector representations in conventional
      neural networks. We use a probabilistic model of the memory capacity using Fisher
      information and investigate how the memory capacity for matrix representation
      networks are limited under various constraints, and in general, without any
      constraints. In the case of memory capacity without any constraints, we found

      "In 2019, the rapid rate at which GPU manufacturers refresh their designs, coupled
      with their reluctance to disclose microarchitectural details, is still a hurdle
      for those software designers who want to extract the highest possible performance.
      Last year, these very reasons motivated us to dissect the Volta GPU architecture
      using microbenchmarks. \nThe introduction in August 2018 of Turing, NVidia''s
      latest architecture, pressed us to update our study. In this report, we examine
      Turing and compare it quantitatively against previous NVidia GPU generations.
      Specifically, we study the T4 GPU: a low-power board aiming at inference applications.
      We describe its improvements against its inference-oriented predecessor: the
      P4 GPU based on the Pascal architecture. Both T4 and P4 GPUs achieve significantly
      higher frequency-per-Watt figures than their full-size counterparts. \nWe study
      the performance of the T4''s TensorCores, finding a much higher throughput on
      low-precision operands than on the P4 GPU. We reveal that Turing introduces
      new instructions that express matrix math more succinctly. We map Turing''s
      instruction space, finding the same encoding as Volta, and additional instructions.
      We reveal that the Turing TU104 chip has the same memory hierarchy depth as
      the Volta GV100; cache levels sizes on the TU104 are frequently twice as large
      as those found on the Pascal GP104. We benchmark each constituent of the T4
      memory hierarchy and find substantial overall performance improvements over
      its P4 predecessor. We studied how clock throttling affects compute-intensive
      workloads that hit power or thermal limits. \nMany of our findings are novel,
      published here for the first time. All of them can guide high-performance software
      developers get closer to the GPU''s peak performance.", "venue": "arXiv.org",

      "For a given distribution, learning algorithm, and performance metric, the rate

      in both theory and practice have power-law rates, i.e. performance scales as
      $n^{-\\alpha}$ for some $\\alpha>0$. Moreover, both theoreticians and practitioners
      are concerned with improving the rates of their learning algorithms under settings
      of interest. We observe the existence of a\"universal learner\", which achieves
      the best possible distribution-dependent asymptotic rate among all learning
      algorithms within a specified runtime (e.g. $O(n^2)$), while incurring only
      polylogarithmic slowdown over this runtime. This algorithm is uniform, and does
      not depend on the distribution, and yet achieves best-possible rates for all
      distributions. The construction itself is a simple extension of Levin''s universal

      Constructions", "abstract": "We develop synthetic notions of oracle computability
      and Turing reducibility in the Calculus of Inductive Constructions (CIC), the
      constructive type theory underlying the Coq proof assistant. As usual in synthetic
      approaches, we employ a definition of oracle computations based on meta-level
      functions rather than object-level models of computation, relying on the fact
      that in constructive systems such as CIC all definable functions are computable
      by construction. Such an approach lends itself well to machine-checked proofs,
      which we carry out in Coq. There is a tension in finding a good synthetic rendering
      of the higher-order notion of oracle computability. On the one hand, it has
      to be informative enough to prove central results, ensuring that all notions
      are faithfully captured. On the other hand, it has to be restricted enough to
      benefit from axioms for synthetic computability, which usually concern first-order
      objects. Drawing inspiration from a definition by Andrej Bauer based on continuous
      functions in the effective topos, we use a notion of sequential continuity to
      characterise valid oracle computations. As main technical results, we show that
      Turing reducibility forms an upper semilattice, transports decidability, and
      is strictly more expressive than truth-table reducibility, and prove that whenever

      "title": "Towards Digital Nature: Bridging the Gap between Turing Machine Objects
      and Linguistic Objects in LLMMs for Universal Interaction of Object-Oriented
      Descriptions", "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel approach to establish
      a connection between linguistic objects and classes in Large Language Model
      Machines (LLMMs) such as GPT3.5 and GPT4, and their counterparts in high level
      programming languages like Python. Our goal is to promote the development of
      Digital Nature: a worldview where digital and physical realities are seamlessly
      intertwined and can be easily manipulated by computational means. To achieve
      this, we exploit the inherent abstraction capabilities of LLMMs to build a bridge
      between human perception of the real world and the computational processes that
      mimic it. This approach enables ambiguous class definitions and interactions
      between objects to be realized in programming and ubiquitous computing scenarios.
      By doing so, we aim to facilitate seamless interaction between Turing Machine
      objects and Linguistic Objects, paving the way for universally accessible object
      oriented descriptions. We demonstrate a method for automatically transforming
      real world objects and their corresponding simulations into language simulable
      worlds using LLMMs, thus advancing the digital twin concept. This process can
      then be extended to high level programming languages, making the implementation
      of these simulations more accessible and practical. In summary, our research
      introduces a groundbreaking approach to connect linguistic objects in LLMMs
      with high level programming languages, allowing for the efficient implementation
      of real world simulations. This ultimately contributes to the realization of
      Digital Nature, where digital and physical worlds are interconnected, and objects
      and simulations can be effortlessly manipulated through computational means.",

      "title": "Counter Turing Test CT^2: AI-Generated Text Detection is Not as Easy
      as You May Think - Introducing AI Detectability Index", "abstract": "With the
      rise of prolific ChatGPT, the risk and consequences of AI-generated text has
      increased alarmingly. To address the inevitable question of ownership attribution
      for AI-generated artifacts, the US Copyright Office released a statement stating
      that ''If a work''s traditional elements of authorship were produced by a machine,
      the work lacks human authorship and the Office will not register it''. Furthermore,
      both the US and the EU governments have recently drafted their initial proposals
      regarding the regulatory framework for AI. Given this cynosural spotlight on
      generative AI, AI-generated text detection (AGTD) has emerged as a topic that
      has already received immediate attention in research, with some initial methods
      having been proposed, soon followed by emergence of techniques to bypass detection.
      This paper introduces the Counter Turing Test (CT^2), a benchmark consisting
      of techniques aiming to offer a comprehensive evaluation of the robustness of
      existing AGTD techniques. Our empirical findings unequivocally highlight the
      fragility of the proposed AGTD methods under scrutiny. Amidst the extensive
      deliberations on policy-making for regulating AI development, it is of utmost
      importance to assess the detectability of content generated by LLMs. Thus, to
      establish a quantifiable spectrum facilitating the evaluation and ranking of
      LLMs according to their detectability levels, we propose the AI Detectability
      Index (ADI). We conduct a thorough examination of 15 contemporary LLMs, empirically
      demonstrating that larger LLMs tend to have a higher ADI, indicating they are
      less detectable compared to smaller LLMs. We firmly believe that ADI holds significant
      value as a tool for the wider NLP community, with the potential to serve as
      a rubric in AI-related policy-making.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023,

      "abstract": "We demonstrate that, through appropriate prompting, GPT-3 family
      of models can be triggered to perform iterative behaviours necessary to execute
      (rather than just write or recall) programs that involve loops, including several
      popular algorithms found in computer science curricula or software developer
      interviews. We trigger execution and description of Iterations by Regimenting
      Self-Attention (IRSA) in one (or a combination) of three ways: 1) Using strong
      repetitive structure in an example of an execution path of a target program
      for one particular input, 2) Prompting with fragments of execution paths, and
      3) Explicitly forbidding (skipping) self-attention to parts of the generated
      text. On a dynamic program execution, IRSA leads to larger accuracy gains than
      replacing the model with the much more powerful GPT-4. IRSA has promising applications
      in education, as the prompts and responses resemble student assignments in data
      structures and algorithms classes. Our findings hold implications for evaluating
      LLMs, which typically target the in-context learning: We show that prompts that
      may not even cover one full task example can trigger algorithmic behaviour,

      "title": "Turing Machines Equipped with CTC in Physical Universes", "abstract":
      "We study the paradoxical aspects of closed time-like curves and their impact
      on the theory of computation. After introducing the $\\text{TM}_\\text{CTC}$,
      a classical Turing machine benefiting CTCs for backward time travel, Aaronson
      et al. proved that $\\text{P} = \\text{PSPACE}$ and the $\\Delta_2$ sets, such
      as the halting problem, are computable within this computational model. Our
      critical view is the physical consistency of this model, which leads to proposing
      the strong axiom, explaining that every particle rounding on a CTC will be destroyed
      before returning to its starting time, and the weak axiom, describing the same
      notion, particularly for Turing machines. We claim that in a universe containing
      CTCs, the two axioms must be true; otherwise, there will be an infinite number
      of any particle rounding on a CTC in the universe. An immediate result of the
      weak axiom is the incapability of Turing machines to convey information for
      a full round on a CTC, leading to the proposed $\\text{TM}_\\text{CTC}$ programs
      for the aforementioned corollaries failing to function. We suggest our solution
      for this problem as the data transferring hypothesis, which applies another
      $\\text{TM}_\\text{CTC}$ as a means for storing data. A prerequisite for it
      is the existence of the concept of Turing machines throughout time, which makes
      it appear infeasible in our universe. Then, we discuss possible physical conditions
      that can be held for a universe containing CTCs and conclude that if returning
      to an approximately equivalent universe by a CTC was conceivable, the above
      corollaries would be valid.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

      a database system, SQL interpretation and execution module is necessary. According

      "title": "Reinforcement Learning Neural Turing Machines", "abstract": "The expressive
      power of a machine learning model is closely related to the number of sequential
      computational steps it can learn. For example, Deep Neural Networks have been
      more successful than shallow networks because they can perform a greater number
      of sequential computational steps (each highly parallel). The Neural Turing
      Machine (NTM) [8] is a model that can compactly express an even greater number
      of sequential computational steps, so it is even more powerful than a DNN. Its
      memory addressing operations are designed to be differentiable; thus the NTM
      can be trained with backpropagation. While differentiable memory is relatively
      easy to implement and train, it necessitates accessing the entire memory content
      at each computational step. This makes it difficult to implement a fast NTM.
      In this work, we use the Re inforce algorithm to learn where to access the memory,
      while using backpropagation to learn what to write to the memory. We call this
      model the RL-NTM. Reinforce allows our model to access a constant number of
      memory cells at each computational step, so its implementation can be faster.
      The RL-NTM is the first mo del that can, in principle, learn programs of unbounded

      "title": "There is no general AI: Why Turing machines cannot pass the Turing
      test", "abstract": "Since 1950, when Alan Turing proposed what has since come
      to be called the Turing test, the ability of a machine to pass this test has
      established itself as the primary hallmark of general AI. To pass the test,
      a machine would have to be able to engage in dialogue in such a way that a human
      interrogator could not distinguish its behaviour from that of a human being.
      AI researchers have attempted to build machines that could meet this requirement,
      but they have so far failed. To pass the test, a machine would have to meet
      two conditions: (i) react appropriately to the variance in human dialogue and
      (ii) display a human-like personality and intentions. We argue, first, that
      it is for mathematical reasons impossible to program a machine which can master
      the enormously complex and constantly evolving pattern of variance which human
      dialogues contain. And second, that we do not know how to make machines that
      possess personality and intentions of the sort we find in humans. Since a Turing
      machine cannot master human dialogue behaviour, we conclude that a Turing machine
      also cannot possess what is called ``general'''' Artificial Intelligence. We
      do, however, acknowledge the potential of Turing machines to master dialogue
      behaviour in highly restricted contexts, where what is called ``narrow'''' AI
      can still be of considerable utility.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2019,

      networks is that they struggle to retain long-time information dependencies
      in their recurrent connections. Neural Turing Machines (NTMs) attempt to mitigate
      this issue by providing the neural network with an external portion of memory,
      in which information can be stored and manipulated later on. The whole mechanism
      is differentiable end-to-end, allowing the network to learn how to utilise this
      long-term memory via stochastic gradient descent. This allows NTMs to infer
      simple algorithms directly from data sequences. Nonetheless, the model can be
      hard to train due to a large number of parameters and interacting components
      and little related work is present. In this work we use NTMs to learn and generalise
      two arithmetical tasks: binary addition and multiplication. These tasks are
      two fundamental algorithmic examples in computer science, and are a lot more

      "abstract": "Deep learning has achieved impressive results in many areas of
      Computer Vision and Natural Language Pro- cessing. Among others, Visual Question
      Answering (VQA), also referred to a visual Turing test, is considered one of
      the most compelling problems, and recent deep learning models have reported
      significant progress in vision and language modeling. Although Artificial Intelligence
      (AI) is getting closer to passing the visual Turing test, at the same time the
      existence of adversarial examples to deep learning systems may hinder the practical
      application of such systems. In this work, we conduct the first extensive study
      on adversarial examples for VQA systems. In particular, we focus on generating
      targeted adversarial examples for a VQA system while the target is considered
      to be a question-answer pair. Our evaluation shows that the success rate of
      whether a targeted adversarial example can be generated is mostly dependent
      on the choice of the target question-answer pair, and less on the choice of
      images to which the question refers. We also report the language prior phenomenon
      of a VQA model, which can explain why targeted adversarial examples are hard
      to generate for some question-answer targets. We also demonstrate that a compositional
      VQA architecture is slightly more resilient to adversarial attacks than a non-compositional
      one. Our study sheds new light on how to build deep vision and language resilient

      ability is compulsory in the curriculum from year one to year 12. It is an indispensable

      "title": "Sub-Turing Islands in the Wild", "abstract": "Recently, there has
      been growing debate as to whether or not static analysis can be truly sound.
      In spite of this concern, research on techniques seeking to at least partially
      answer undecidable questions has a long history. However, little attention has
      been given to the more empirical question of how often an exact solution might
      be given to a question despite the question being, at least in theory, undecidable.
      This paper investigates this issue by exploring sub-Turing islands -- regions
      of code for which a question of interest is decidable. We define such islands
      and then consider how to identify them. We implemented Cook, a prototype for
      finding sub-Turing islands and applied it to a corpus of 1100 Android applications,
      containing over 2 million methods. Results reveal that 55\\% of the all methods
      are sub-Turing. Our results also provide empirical, scientific evidence for
      the scalability of sub-Turing island identification. Sub-Turing identification
      has many downstream applications, because islands are so amenable to static
      analysis. We illustrate two downstream uses of the analysis. In the first, we
      found that over 37\\% of the verification conditions associated with runtime
      exceptions fell within sub-Turing islands and thus are statically decidable.
      A second use of our analysis is during code review where it provides guidance
      to developers. The sub-Turing islands from our study turns out to contain significantly
      fewer bugs than `theswamp'' (non sub-Turing methods). The greater bug density
      in the swamp is unsurprising; the fact that bugs remain prevalent in islands
      is, however, surprising: these are bugs whose repair can be fully automated.",

      machine''s behavior is indistinguishable from a human. The most popular and
      practical Turing test is CAPTCHA, which is to discriminate algorithm from human
      by offering recognition-alike questions. The recent development of deep learning
      has significantly advanced the capability of algorithm in solving CAPTCHA questions,
      forcing CAPTCHA designers to increase question complexity. Instead of designing
      questions difficult for both algorithm and human, this study attempts to employ
      the limitations of algorithm to design robust CAPTCHA questions easily solvable
      to human. Specifically, our data analysis observes that human and algorithm
      demonstrates different vulnerability to visual distortions: adversarial perturbation
      is significantly annoying to algorithm yet friendly to human. We are motivated
      to employ adversarially perturbed images for robust CAPTCHA design in the context
      of character-based questions. Three modules of multi-target attack, ensemble
      adversarial training, and image preprocessing differentiable approximation are
      proposed to address the characteristics of character-based CAPTCHA cracking.
      Qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness
      of the proposed solution. We hope this study can lead to the discussions around

      typically involves learning the graph structure and the relationship between
      the nodes of the graph. However, learning the graph structure is often complex,
      particularly when the graph is cyclic, and the transitions from one node to
      another are conditioned such as graphs used to represent a finite state machine.
      To solve this problem, we propose to extend the memory based Neural Turing Machine
      (NTM) with two novel additions. We allow for transitions between nodes to be
      influenced by information received from external environments, and we let the
      NTM learn the context of those transitions. We refer to this extension as the
      Conditional Neural Turing Machine (CNTM). \nWe show that the CNTM can infer
      conditional transition graphs by empirically verifiying the model on two data
      sets: a large set of randomly generated graphs, and a graph modeling the information
      retrieval process during certain crisis situations. The results show that the

      "This paper aims to question the suitability of the Turing Test, for testing
      machine intelligence, in the light of advances made in the last 60 years in
      science, medicine, and philosophy of mind. While the main concept of the test
      may seem sound and valid, a detailed analysis of what is required to pass the
      test highlights a significant flow. Once the analysis of the test is presented,
      a systematic approach is followed in analysing what is needed to devise a test
      or tests for intelligent machines. The paper presents a plausible generic framework
      based on categories of factors implied by subjective perception of intelligence.

      "title": "Taking Turing by Surprise? Designing Digital Computers for morally-loaded
      contexts", "abstract": "There is much to learn from what Turing hastily dismissed
      as Lady Lovelace s objection. Digital computers can indeed surprise us. Just
      like a piece of art, algorithms can be designed in such a way as to lead us
      to question our understanding of the world, or our place within it. Some humans
      do lose the capacity to be surprised in that way. It might be fear, or it might
      be the comfort of ideological certainties. As lazy normative animals, we do
      need to be able to rely on authorities to simplify our reasoning: that is ok.
      Yet the growing sophistication of systems designed to free us from the constraints
      of normative engagement may take us past a point of no-return. What if, through
      lack of normative exercise, our moral muscles became so atrophied as to leave
      us unable to question our social practices? This paper makes two distinct normative
      claims: \n1. Decision-support systems should be designed with a view to regularly
      jolting us out of our moral torpor. \n2. Without the depth of habit to somatically
      anchor model certainty, a computer s experience of something new is very different
      from that which in humans gives rise to non-trivial surprises. This asymmetry
      has key repercussions when it comes to the shape of ethical agency in artificial
      moral agents. The worry is not just that they would be likely to leap morally
      ahead of us, unencumbered by habits. The main reason to doubt that the moral
      trajectories of humans v. autonomous systems might remain compatible stems from
      the asymmetry in the mechanisms underlying moral change. Whereas in humans surprises
      will continue to play an important role in waking us to the need for moral change,
      cognitive processes will rule when it comes to machines. This asymmetry will
      translate into increasingly different moral outlooks, to the point of likely
      unintelligibility. The latter prospect is enough to doubt the desirability of
      autonomous moral agents.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2018, "referenceCount":

      computing: the format is fully determinate and computations are information
      preserving. Distributed representations lack these properties and cannot be
      fully captured by Turing''s standard model. To address this limitation a distributed
      extension of the Turing Machine is introduced in this paper. In the extended
      machine, functions and abstractions are expressed extensionally and computations
      are entropic. The machine is applied to the definition of an associative memory,
      with its corresponding memory register, recognition and retrieval operations.
      The memory is tested with an experiment for storing and recognizing hand written
      digits with satisfactory results. The experiment can be seen as a proof of concept
      that information can be stored and processed effectively in a highly distributed
      fashion using a symbolic but not fully determinate format. The new machine augments
      the symbolic mode of computing with consequences on the way Church Thesis is
      understood. The paper is concluded with a discussion of some implications of
      the extended machine for Artificial Intelligence and Cognition.", "venue": "arXiv.org",
