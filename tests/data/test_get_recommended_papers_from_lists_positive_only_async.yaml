      "title": "Efficient Construction of Directed Hopsets and Parallel Single-source
      Shortest Paths (Abstract)", "abstract": "The single-source shortest-path problem
      is as follows: given a graph with nonnegative edge weights and a designated
      source vertex s, return the distances from~s to each other vertex such. This
      paper presents a randomized parallel single-source shortest paths (SSSP) algorithm
      for directed graphs with non-negative integer edge weights that solves the exact
      SSSP problem in O (m) work and n^1/2+o(1) span, with high probability. All previous
      exact SSSP algorithms with nearly linear work have linear span, even for undirected
      unweighted graphs. To solve exact SSSP problem, we first show a deterministic
      reduction from exact SSSP to directed hopsets using the iterative gradual rounding
      technique. An (\u03b2, \u03b5)-hopset is a set of weighted edges, also known
      as shortcuts, that when added to the graph, admit \u03b2-hop paths with weights
      no more than (1 + \u03b5) times the true shortest path distances. We show that
      (\u03b2, \u03b5)-hopsets can be used to solve the exact SSSP problem in O (m)
      work and O (\u03b2) span. Furthermore, we present the first nearly linear-work
      algorithm for constructing hopsets on directed graphs. Our sequential algorithm
      runs in O (m) time and constructs a hopset with O (n) edges and \u03b2 = n^1/2+o(1)
      . We also provide a parallel version of the algorithm with O (m) work and n^1/2+o(1)
      span. The directed hopsets can be used to solve approximate SSSP problems efficiently,
      where the objective is to return estimates of the distances from the source
      vertex to every other vertex such that the estimate falls between the true distance
      and (1+\u03b5) times the distance. Specifically, for constant \u03b5 and graphs
      with polynomially-bounded real edge weights, there is an algorithm solving approximate
      SSSP problem with O (m) work and n^1/2+o(1) span.", "venue": "HOPC@SPAA", "year":

      "title": "Improved Approximation Bounds for Minimum Weight Cycle in the CONGEST
      Model", "abstract": "Minimum Weight Cycle (MWC) is the problem of finding a
      simple cycle of minimum weight in a graph $G=(V,E)$. This is a fundamental graph
      problem with classical sequential algorithms that run in $\\tilde{O}(n^3)$ and
      $\\tilde{O}(mn)$ time where $n=|V|$ and $m=|E|$. In recent years this problem
      has received significant attention in the context of hardness through fine grained
      sequential complexity as well as in design of faster sequential approximation
      algorithms. For computing minimum weight cycle in the distributed CONGEST model,
      near-linear in $n$ lower and upper bounds on round complexity are known for
      directed graphs (weighted and unweighted), and for undirected weighted graphs;
      these lower bounds also apply to any $(2-\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm.
      This paper focuses on round complexity bounds for approximating MWC in the CONGEST
      model: For coarse approximations we show that for any constant $\\alpha>1$,
      computing an $\\alpha$-approximation of MWC requires $\\Omega (\\frac{\\sqrt
      n}{\\log n})$ rounds on weighted undirected graphs and on directed graphs, even
      if unweighted. We complement these lower bounds with sublinear $\\tilde{O}(n^{2/3}+D)$-round
      algorithms for approximating MWC close to a factor of 2 in these classes of
      graphs. A key ingredient of our approximation algorithms is an efficient algorithm
      for computing $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximate shortest paths from $k$ sources in
      directed and weighted graphs, which may be of independent interest for other
      CONGEST problems. We present an algorithm that runs in $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{nk}

      "title": "The Unweighted and Weighted Reverse Shortest Path Problem for Disk
      Graphs", "abstract": "We study the reverse shortest path problem on disk graphs
      in the plane. In this problem we consider the proximity graph of a set of $n$
      disks in the plane of arbitrary radii: In this graph two disks are connected
      if the distance between them is at most some threshold parameter $r$. The case
      of intersection graphs is a special case with $r=0$. We give an algorithm that,
      given a target length $k$, computes the smallest value of $r$ for which there
      is a path of length at most $k$ between some given pair of disks in the proximity
      graph. Our algorithm runs in $O^*(n^{5/4})$ randomized expected time, which
      improves to $O^*(n^{6/5})$ for unit disk graphs, where all the disks have the
      same radius. Our technique is robust and can be applied to many variants of
      the problem. One significant variant is the case of weighted proximity graphs,
      where edges are assigned real weights equal to the distance between the disks
      or between their centers, and $k$ is replaced by a target weight $w$; that is,
      we seek a path whose length is at most $w$. In other variants, we want to optimize
      a parameter different from $r$, such as a scale factor of the radii of the disks.
      The main technique for the decision version of the problem (determining whether
      the graph with a given $r$ has the desired property) is based on efficient implementations
      of BFS (for the unweighted case) and of Dijkstra''s algorithm (for the weighted
      case), using efficient data structures for maintaining the bichromatic closest
      pair for certain bicliques and several distance functions. The optimization
      problem is then solved by combining the resulting decision procedure with enhanced
      variants of the interval shrinking and bifurcation technique of [4].", "venue":

      "title": "Are there graphs whose shortest path structure requires large edge
      weights?", "abstract": "The aspect ratio of a weighted graph $G$ is the ratio
      of its maximum edge weight to its minimum edge weight. Aspect ratio commonly
      arises as a complexity measure in graph algorithms, especially related to the
      computation of shortest paths. Popular paradigms are to interpolate between
      the settings of weighted and unweighted input graphs by incurring a dependence
      on aspect ratio, or by simply restricting attention to input graphs of low aspect
      ratio. This paper studies the effects of these paradigms, investigating whether
      graphs of low aspect ratio have more structured shortest paths than graphs in
      general. In particular, we raise the question of whether one can generally take
      a graph of large aspect ratio and \\emph{reweight} its edges, to obtain a graph
      with bounded aspect ratio while preserving the structure of its shortest paths.
      Our findings are: - Every weighted DAG on $n$ nodes has a shortest-paths preserving
      graph of aspect ratio $O(n)$. A simple lower bound shows that this is tight.
      - The previous result does not extend to general directed or undirected graphs;
      in fact, the answer turns out to be exponential in these settings. In particular,
      we construct directed and undirected $n$-node graphs for which any shortest-paths
      preserving graph has aspect ratio $2^{\\Omega(n)}$. We also consider the approximate
      version of this problem, where the goal is for shortest paths in $H$ to correspond
      to approximate shortest paths in $G$. We show that our exponential lower bounds
      extend even to this setting. We also show that in a closely related model, where
      approximate shortest paths in $H$ must also correspond to approximate shortest
      paths in $G$, even DAGs require exponential aspect ratio.", "venue": "arXiv.org",

      I show that the shortest path distances can be found by a simple matrix inversion:

      is $O(n^{2.032})$ time, using known bounds for rectangular matrix multiplication~$n^{\\omega(r)}$~[Le
      Gall, Urrutia, SODA 2018]. Our result improves on the $\\tilde{O}(n^{2.25})$
      bound of [Roddity, STOC 2023], and on the $\\tilde{O}(m\\sqrt n+n^2)$ bound
      of [Baswana, Kavitha, SICOMP 2010] for graphs with $m\\geq n^{1.532}$ edges.

      the aim is to find an $(s,t)$-path with odd length and, among all such paths,
      of minimum weight. For the case when the weight function is conservative, i.e.,
      when every cycle has non-negative total weight, the complexity of the Shortest
      Odd Path problem had been open for 20 years, and was recently shown to be NP-hard.
      We give a polynomial-time algorithm for the special case when the weight function
      is conservative and the set $E^-$ of negative-weight edges forms a single tree.
      Our algorithm exploits the strong connection between Shortest Odd Path and the
      problem of finding two internally vertex-disjoint paths between two terminals
      in an undirected edge-weighted graph. It also relies on solving an intermediary
      problem variant called Shortest Parity-Constrained Odd Path where for certain
      edges we have parity constraints on their position along the path. Also, we
      exhibit two FPT algorithms for solving Shortest Odd Path in graphs with conservative

      "title": "Towards Bypassing Lower Bounds for Graph Shortcuts", "abstract": "For
      a given (possibly directed) graph G , a hopset (a.k.a. shortcut set) is a (small)
      set of edges whose addition reduces the graph diameter while preserving desired
      properties from the given graph G , such as, reachability and shortest-path
      distances. The key objective is in optimizing the tradeoff between the achieved
      diameter and the size of the shortcut set (possibly also, the distance distortion).
      Despite the centrality of these objects and their thorough study over the years,
      there are still significant gaps between the known upper and lower bound results.
      A common property shared by almost all known shortcut lower bounds is that they
      hold for the seemingly simpler task of reducing the diameter of the given graph,
      D G , by a constant additive term, in fact, even by just one! We denote such
      restricted structures by ( D G \u2212 1)-diameter hopsets. In this paper we
      show that this relaxation can be leveraged to narrow the current gaps, and in
      certain cases to also bypass the known lower bound results, when restricting
      to sparse graphs (with O ( n ) edges): Hopsets for Directed Weighted Sparse
      Graphs. For every n -vertex directed and weighted sparse graph G with D G \u2265
      n 1 / 4 , one can compute an exact ( D G \u2212 1)-diameter hopset of linear
      size. Combining this with known lower bound results for dense graphs, we get
      a separation between dense and sparse graphs, hence shortcutting sparse graphs
      is provably easier . For reachability hopsets, we can provide ( D G \u2212 1)-diameter
      hopsets of linear size, for sparse DAGs, already for D G \u2265 n 1 / 5 . This
      should be compared with the diameter bound of e O ( n 1 / 3 ) [Kogan and Parter,
      SODA 2022], and the lower bound of D G = n 1 / 6 by [Huang and Pettie, SIAM

      we give the first efficient algorithms for the $k$-center problem on dynamic
      graphs undergoing edge updates. In this problem, the goal is to partition the
      input into $k$ sets by choosing $k$ centers such that the maximum distance from
      any data point to the closest center is minimized. It is known that it is NP-hard
      to get a better than $2$ approximation for this problem. While in many applications
      the input may naturally be modeled as a graph, all prior works on $k$-center
      problem in dynamic settings are on metrics. In this paper, we give a deterministic
      decremental $(2+\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm and a randomized incremental
      $(4+\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm, both with amortized update time $kn^{o(1)}$
      for weighted graphs. Moreover, we show a reduction that leads to a fully dynamic
      $(2+\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the $k$-center problem, with worst-case
      update time that is within a factor $k$ of the state-of-the-art upper bound
      for maintaining $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximate single-source distances in graphs.
      Matching this bound is a natural goalpost because the approximate distances
      of each vertex to its center can be used to maintain a $(2+\\epsilon)$-approximation
      of the graph diameter and the fastest known algorithms for such a diameter approximation
      also rely on maintaining approximate single-source distances.", "venue": "arXiv.org",

      all pairs $u,v \\in V(G)$, where $d_{min}(u,v) = \\min(d(u,v), d(v,u))$. Our

      "title": "On Dynamic Graph Algorithms with Predictions", "abstract": "We study
      dynamic algorithms in the model of algorithms with predictions. We assume the
      algorithm is given imperfect predictions regarding future updates, and we ask
      how such predictions can be used to improve the running time. This can be seen
      as a model interpolating between classic online and offline dynamic algorithms.
      Our results give smooth tradeoffs between these two extreme settings. First,
      we give algorithms for incremental and decremental transitive closure and approximate
      APSP that take as an additional input a predicted sequence of updates (edge
      insertions, or edge deletions, respectively). They preprocess it in $\\tilde{O}(n^{(3+\\omega)/2})$
      time, and then handle updates in $\\tilde{O}(1)$ worst-case time and queries
      in $\\tilde{O}(\\eta^2)$ worst-case time. Here $\\eta$ is an error measure that
      can be bounded by the maximum difference between the predicted and actual insertion
      (deletion) time of an edge, i.e., by the $\\ell_\\infty$-error of the predictions.
      The second group of results concerns fully dynamic problems with vertex updates,
      where the algorithm has access to a predicted sequence of the next $n$ updates.
      We show how to solve fully dynamic triangle detection, maximum matching, single-source
      reachability, and more, in $O(n^{\\omega-1}+n\\eta_i)$ worst-case update time.
      Here $\\eta_i$ denotes how much earlier the $i$-th update occurs than predicted.
      Our last result is a reduction that transforms a worst-case incremental algorithm
      without predictions into a fully dynamic algorithm which is given a predicted
      deletion time for each element at the time of its insertion. As a consequence
      we can, e.g., maintain fully dynamic exact APSP with such predictions in $\\tilde{O}(n^2)$
      worst-case vertex insertion time and $\\tilde{O}(n^2 (1+\\eta_i))$ worst-case
      vertex deletion time (for the prediction error $\\eta_i$ defined as above).",

      problem of connecting a new vertex p to a Euclidean graph G using k new edges,,

      p . We aim to connect the vertex in such a way that the maximum dilation from
      p to a set of destination vertices in the graph is minimised, where we de\ufb01ne
      dilation as the ratio between the distance in the graph and Euclidean distance.
      Previous work mainly focus on reducing the dilation to points on the boundary

      maximal dilation is approximated. The \ufb01rst algorithm gives a (1+ \u03b5
      )-approximation for arbitrarily small \u03b5 , however, its running time is
      still exponential in k . The second gives a ( t + 1)-approximation when f is
      a t -spanner and runs in O ( mn 2 log n ) time, where m denotes the number of
      vertices on the boundary of f and n denotes the total number of vertices in
      the graph. The third approximation algorithm also has a running time of O (
      mn 2 log n ) and is obtained after a comparison between dilation and distance
      in the context of feed link placement. Its approximation ratio depends on the
      di\ufb00erence in Euclidean distances between p and the destination vertices.",

      algorithm for checking $k$-connectivity in near-optimal $\\widehat{O}(m)$ time.
      (We use $\\widehat{O}(\\cdot)$ to hide an $n^{o(1)}$ factor.) Deterministic
      algorithms, unfortunately, have remained much slower even if we assume a linear-time
      max-flow algorithm: they either require at least $\\Omega(mn)$ time [Even''75;
      Henzinger Rao and Gabow, FOCS''96; Gabow, FOCS''00] or assume that $k=o(\\sqrt{\\log
      n})$ [Saranurak and Yingchareonthawornchai, FOCS''22]. We show a \\emph{deterministic}
      algorithm for checking $k$-vertex connectivity in time proportional to making
      $\\widehat{O}(k^{2})$ max-flow calls, and, hence, in $\\widehat{O}(mk^{2})$
      time using the deterministic max-flow algorithm by [Brand et al. FOCS''23].
      Our algorithm gives the first almost-linear-time bound for all $k$ where $\\sqrt{\\log
      n}\\le k\\le n^{o(1)}$ and subsumes up to a sub polynomial factor the long-standing
      state-of-the-art algorithm by [Even''75] which requires $O(n+k^{2})$ max-flow
      calls. Our key technique is a deterministic algorithm for terminal reduction
      for vertex connectivity: given a terminal set separated by a vertex mincut,
      output either a vertex mincut or a smaller terminal set that remains separated
      by a vertex mincut. We also show a deterministic $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation
      algorithm for vertex connectivity that makes $O(n/\\epsilon^2)$ max-flow calls,
      improving the bound of $O(n^{1.5})$ max-flow calls in the exact algorithm of
      [Gabow, FOCS''00]. The technique is based on Ramanujan graphs.", "venue": "arXiv.org",

      Finding paths is a fundamental problem in graph theory and algorithm design
      due to its many applications. Recently, this problem has been considered on
      temporal graphs, where edges may change over a discrete time domain. The analysis
      of graphs has also taken into account the relevance of vertex properties, modeled
      by assigning to vertices labels or colors. In this work, we deal with a problem
      that, given a static or temporal graph, whose vertices are colored graph looks
      for a path such that (1) the vertices of the path have distinct colors and (2)
      that path includes the maximum number of colors. We analyze the approximation
      complexity of the problem on static and temporal graphs, and we prove an inapproximability
      bound. Then, we consider the problem on temporal graphs, and we design a heuristic
      for it. We present an experimental evaluation of our heuristic, both on synthetic
      and real-world graphs. The experimental results show that for many instances
      of the problem, our method is able to return near-optimal solutions.", "venue":

      "title": "Another Hamiltonian Cycle in Bipartite Pfaffian Graphs", "abstract":
      "We present a linear-time algorithm that, given as input (i) a bipartite Pfaffian
      graph $G$ of minimum degree three, (ii) a Hamiltonian cycle $H$ in $G$, and
      (iii) an edge $e$ in $H$, outputs at least three other Hamiltonian cycles through
      the edge $e$ in $G$. This linear-time complexity of finding another Hamiltonian
      cycle given one is in sharp contrast to the problem of deciding the existence
      of a Hamiltonian cycle, which is NP-complete already for cubic bipartite planar
      graphs; such graphs are Pfaffian. Also, without the degree requirement, we show
      that it is NP-hard to find another Hamiltonian cycle in a bipartite Pfaffian
      graph. We present further improved algorithms for finding optimal traveling
      salesperson tours and counting Hamiltonian cycles in bipartite planar graphs
      with running times that are not known to hold in general planar graphs. We prove
      our results by a new structural technique that efficiently witnesses each Hamiltonian
      cycle $H$ through an arbitrary fixed anchor edge $e$ in a bipartite Pfaffian
      graph using a two-coloring of the vertices as advice that is unique to $H$.
      Previous techniques -- the Cut&Count technique of Cygan et al. [FOCS''11, TALG''22]
      in particular -- were able to reduce the Hamiltonian cycle problem only to essentially
      counting problems; our results show that counting can be avoided by leveraging
      properties of bipartite Pfaffian graphs. Our technique also has purely graph-theoretical
      consequences; for example, we show that every cubic bipartite Pfaffian graph
      has either zero or at least six distinct Hamiltonian cycles; the latter case
      is tight for the cube graph.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

      Design Problem with Uniform Demands", "abstract": "In the Vertex Connectivity
      Survivable Network Design (VC-SNDP) problem, the input is a graph G and a function
      d : V ( G ) \u00d7 V ( G ) \u2192 N that encodes the vertex-connectivity demands
      between pairs of vertices. The objective is to find the smallest subgraph H
      of G that satisfies all these demands. It is a well-studied NP-complete problem
      that generalizes several network design problems. We consider the case of uniform
      demands , where for every vertex pair ( u, v ) the connectivity demand d ( u,
      v ) is a fixed integer \u03ba . It is an important problem with wide applications.
      We study this problem in the realm of Parameterized Complexity. In this setting,
      in addition to G and d we are given an integer \u2113 as the parameter and the
      objective is to determine if we can remove at least \u2113 edges from G without
      violating any connectivity constraints. This was posed as an open problem by
      Bang-Jansen et.al. [SODA 2018], who studied the edge-connectivity variant of
      the problem under the same settings. Using a powerful classification result
      of Lokshtanov et al. [ICALP 2018], Gutin et al. [JCSS 2019] recently showed
      that this problem admits a (non-uniform) FPT algorithm where the running time
      was unspecified. Further they also gave an (uniform) FPT algorithm for the case
      of \u03ba = 2. In this paper we present a (uniform) FPT algorithm any \u03ba
      that runs in time 2 O ( \u03ba 2 \u2113 4 log \u2113 ) \u00b7 | V ( G ) | O

      Our main conceptual contribution is a novel graph decomposition called the Wheel
      decomposition . Informally, it is a partition of the edge set of a graph G ,
      E ( G ) = X 1 \u222a X 2 . . . \u222a X r , with the parts arranged in a cyclic
      order, such that each vertex v \u2208 V ( G ) either has edges in at most two
      consecutive parts, or has edges in every part of this partition. The first kind
      of vertices can be thought of as the rim of the wheel, while the second kind
      form the hub. Additionally, the vertex cuts induced by these edge-sets in G
      have highly symmetric properties. Our main technical result, informally speaking,
      establishes that \u201cnearly edge-minimal\u201d \u03ba -vertex connected graphs
      admit a wheel decomposition \u2013 a fact that can be exploited for designing

      is to find a sequence of nodes from $V$, called a burning sequence, to burn
      the whole graph. This is a discrete-step process, and at each step, an unburned
      vertex is selected as an agent to spread fire to its neighbors by marking it
      as a burnt node. A burnt node spreads the fire to its neighbors at the next
      consecutive step. The goal is to find the burning sequence of minimum length.
      The Graph Burning problem is NP-Hard for general graphs and even for binary
      trees. A few approximation results are known, including a $ 3$-approximation
      algorithm for general graphs and a $ 2$-approximation algorithm for trees. The

      y of G , there exists a tree T in T ( G ) with d T ( x, y ) \u2264 3 \u00b7
      d G ( x, y ) + 12. That is, the distances in any UDG can be approximately represented
      by the distances in at most 2 log 32 n + 2 of its spanning trees. Using these
      results, we propose a new compact and low delay routing labeling scheme for
      UDGs. They often model wireless ad hoc networks. We show that one can assign
      each vertex of an n -vertex UDG G a compact O (log 2 n )-bit label such that,
      given the label of a source vertex and the label of a destination, it is possible
      to compute e\ufb03ciently, based solely on these two labels, a neighbor of the
      source vertex that heads in the direction of the destination. We prove that
      this routing labeling scheme has a constant hop route-stretch (= hop delay ),
      i.e., for each two vertices x and y of G , it produces a routing path with h
      ( x, y ) hops (edges) such that h ( x, y ) \u2264 3 \u00b7 d G ( x, y ) + 12,
      where d G ( x, y ) is the hop distance between x and y in G . To the best of
      our knowledge, this is the \ufb01rst compact routing scheme for UDGs which not
      only guaranties delivery but has a low hop delay. It is easy to see that, for
      UDGs, a constant hop route-stretch implies a constant length route-stretch and
      a constant power route-stretch .", "venue": "", "year": 2008, "referenceCount":

      "The Connected Max Cut ( CMC ) problem takes in an undirected graph G ( V, E

      This problem is closely related to the Max Leaf Degree ( MLD ) problem. The
      input to the MLD problem is an undirected graph G ( V, E ) and the goal is to
      find a subtree of G that maximizes the degree (in G ) of its leaves. [Gandhi

      an O ( \u03b1 )-approximation for the CMC problem. We present an O (log log

      an O (log log | V | )-approximation algorithm for the CMC problem. Thus, improving

      problems on directed graphs: Hamiltonian Cycle and its generalization {\\sc
      Longest Cycle}. Since 2008, it is known that Hamiltonian Cycle is W[1]-hard
      when parameterized by directed treewidth [Lampis et al., ISSAC''08]. By now,
      the question of whether it is FPT parameterized by the directed feedback vertex
      set (DFVS) number has become a longstanding open problem. In particular, the
      DFVS number is the largest natural directed width measure studied in the literature.
      In this paper, we provide a negative answer to the question, showing that even
      for the DFVS number, the problem remains W[1]-hard. As a consequence, we also
      obtain that Longest Cycle is W[1]-hard on directed graphs when parameterized
      multiplicatively above girth, in contrast to the undirected case. This resolves
      an open question posed by Fomin et al. [ACM ToCT''21] and Gutin and Mnich [arXiv:2207.12278].

      Acyclic Graphs", "abstract": "Graphs and graph unions. We mostly follow the
      graph theory terminology of Andersson et al. [1997]. A graph is undirected if
      all its edges are undirected, directed if all its edges are directed, and partially
      directed if it contains both directed and undirected edges. A directed graph
      that has no directed cycle is called a directed acyclic graph (DAG). A generalization
      of this idea is that of chain graphs: a partially directed graph is called a
      chain graph if it has no cycle which contains (i) at least one directed edge,
      and (ii) in which all directed edges are directed in the same direction as one
      moves along the cycle. We denote the neighbors of a vertex v in a graph G as
      NG(v), and an induced subgraph of G on a set X \u2286 V is denoted as G[X].
      The graph union (which we just call \u201cunion\u201d) G1 \u222aG2 includes
      vertices and edges present in any one of G1 or G2, i.e., VG1\u222aG2 = VG1 \u222aVG2

      G is an undirected version of G which we get by ignoring the direction of all
      the edges: in particular, note that the skeleton of a partially directed graph
      is also the graph union of all the partially directed graphs with the same skeleton
      as G. A v-structure (or unshielded collider) in a partially directed graph G

      the simple implementation using another characterization that a certain structure

      interested in maintaining whether the graph is strongly connected, we give an
      efficient deterministic black-box reduction to (arbitrary-pair) dynamic reachability.
      Consequently, for dynamic strong connectivity we match the best-known O ( n
      1 . 407 ) worst-case upper bound for dynamic reachability [van den Brand, Nanongkai,

      upon the previous O ( n 1 . 529 ) bound. Our reduction also yields the first

      how the relationship between non-equivalent width parameters changes once we
      restrict to some special graph class. As width parameters, we consider treewidth,
      clique-width, twin-width, mim-width, sim-width and tree-independence number,
      whereas as graph classes we consider $K_{t,t}$-subgraph-free graphs, line graphs
      and their common superclass, for $t \\geq 3$, of $K_{t,t}$-free graphs. We first
      provide a complete comparison when restricted to $K_{t,t}$-subgraph-free graphs,
      showing in particular that treewidth, clique-width, mim-width, sim-width and
      tree-independence number are all equivalent. This extends a result of Gurski
      and Wanke (2000) stating that treewidth and clique-width are equivalent for
      the class of $K_{t,t}$-subgraph-free graphs. Next, we provide a complete comparison
      when restricted to line graphs, showing in particular that, on any class of
      line graphs, clique-width, mim-width, sim-width and tree-independence number
      are all equivalent, and bounded if and only if the class of root graphs has

      a class of graphs~${\\cal G}$ has bounded treewidth if and only if the class
      of line graphs of graphs in ${\\cal G}$ has bounded clique-width. We then provide
      an almost-complete comparison for $K_{t,t}$-free graphs, leaving one missing

      "A connected graph is 4-connected if it contains at least five vertices and
      removing any three of them does not disconnect it. A frequent preprocessing
      step in graph drawing is to decompose a plane graph into its 4-connected components

      was already proposed by Kant. However, using common graph data structures, we
      found the subroutine dealing with triangulated graphs difficult to implement
      in such a way that it actually runs in linear time. As a drop-in replacement,

      we are given an $n$-node, $m$-edge input graph $G$, and the goal is to compute
      a spanning subgraph $H$ on $O(n)$ edges. This can be achieved in linear $O(m
      + n)$ time via breadth-first search. But can we hope for \\emph{sublinear} runtime
      in some range of parameters? If the goal is to return $H$ as an adjacency list,
      there are simple lower bounds showing that $\\Omega(m + n)$ runtime is necessary.
      If the goal is to return $H$ as an adjacency matrix, then we need $\\Omega(n^2)$
      time just to write down the entries of the output matrix. However, we show that
      neither of these lower bounds still apply if instead the goal is to return $H$
      as an \\emph{implicit} adjacency matrix, which we call an \\emph{adjacency oracle}.
      An adjacency oracle is a data structure that gives a user the illusion that
      an adjacency matrix has been computed: it accepts edge queries $(u, v)$, and
      it returns in near-constant time a bit indicating whether $(u, v) \\in E(H)$.
      Our main result is that one can construct an adjacency oracle for a spanning
      subgraph on at most $(1+\\varepsilon)n$ edges, in $\\tilde{O}(n \\varepsilon^{-1})$
      time, and that this construction time is near-optimal. Additional results include
      constructions of adjacency oracles for $k$-connectivity certificates and spanners,
      which are similarly sublinear on dense-enough input graphs. Our adjacency oracles
      are closely related to Local Computation Algorithms (LCAs) for graph sparsifiers;
      they can be viewed as LCAs with some computation moved to a preprocessing step,
      in order to speed up queries. Our oracles imply the first Local algorithm for
      computing sparse spanning subgraphs of general input graphs in $\\tilde{O}(n)$

      and then throwing the rest of the oracle away. This addresses an open problem

      represent similarity, and the task is to partition the vertices into two equally
      sized clusters, while minimizing the number of pairs of similar objects that

      "The Graphical House Allocation (GHA) problem asks: how can $n$ houses (each
      with a fixed non-negative value) be assigned to the vertices of an undirected
      graph $G$, so as to minimize the sum of absolute differences along the edges
      of $G$? This problem generalizes the classical Minimum Linear Arrangement problem,
      as well as the well-known House Allocation Problem from Economics. Recent work
      has studied the computational aspects of GHA and observed that the problem is
      NP-hard and inapproximable even on particularly simple classes of graphs, such
      as vertex disjoint unions of paths. However, the dependence of any approximations
      on the structural properties of the underlying graph had not been studied. In
      this work, we give a nearly complete characterization of the approximability
      of GHA. We present algorithms to approximate the optimal envy on general graphs,
      trees, planar graphs, bounded-degree graphs, and bounded-degree planar graphs.
      For each of these graph classes, we then prove matching lower bounds, showing
      that in each case, no significant improvement can be attained unless P = NP.
      We also present general approximation ratios as a function of structural parameters
      of the underlying graph, such as treewidth; these match the tight upper bounds
      in general, and are significantly better approximations for many natural subclasses
      of graphs. Finally, we investigate the special case of bounded-degree trees
      in some detail. We first refute a conjecture by Hosseini et al. [2023] about
      the structural properties of exact optimal allocations on binary trees by means
      of a counterexample on a depth-$3$ complete binary tree. This refutation, together
      with our hardness results on trees, might suggest that approximating the optimal
      envy even on complete binary trees is infeasible. Nevertheless, we present a
      linear-time algorithm that attains a $3$-approximation on complete binary trees.",

      multiple recent publications in the field adapt existing labeling methods in
      an ad-hoc fashion to their specific problem variant without considering the
      underlying general structure: they always deal with multi-criteria scenarios
      and those criteria define different partial orders on the paths. In this paper,
      we introduce the partial order shortest path problem (POSP), a generalization
      of the multi-objective shortest path problem (MOSP) and in turn also of the
      classical shortest path problem. POSP captures the particular structure of many
      shortest path applications as special cases. In this generality, we study optimality
      conditions or the lack of them, depending on the objective functions'' properties.
      Our final contribution is a big lookup table summarizing our findings and providing
      the reader an easy way to choose among the most recent multicriteria shortest

      from time-dependent shortest path and bottleneck path problems to the fuzzy

      "In the Metric Dimension problem, one asks for a minimum-size set R of vertices
      such that for any pair of vertices of the graph, there is a vertex from R whose
      two distances to the vertices of the pair are distinct. This problem has mainly
      been studied on undirected graphs and has gained a lot of attention in the recent
      years. We focus on directed graphs, and show how to solve the problem in linear-time
      on digraphs whose underlying undirected graph (ignoring multiple edges) is a
      tree. This (nontrivially) extends a previous algorithm for oriented trees. We
      then extend the method to unicyclic digraphs (understood as the digraphs whose
      underlying undirected multigraph has a unique cycle). We also give a fixed-parameter-tractable
      algorithm for digraphs when parameterized by the directed modular-width, extending
      a known result for undirected graphs. Finally, we show that Metric Dimension
      is NP-hard even on planar triangle-free acyclic digraphs of maximum degree 6.",

      "abstract": "A graph G is a k-leaf power, for an integer k>= 2, if there is
      a tree T with leaf set V(G) such that, for all vertices x, y in V(G), the edge
      xy exists in G if and only if the distance between x and y in T is at most k.
      Such a tree T is called a k-leaf root of G. The computational problem of constructing
      a k-leaf root for a given graph G and an integer k, if any, is motivated by
      the challenge from computational biology to reconstruct phylogenetic trees.
      For fixed k, Lafond [SODA 2022] recently solved this problem in polynomial time.
      In this paper, we propose to study optimal leaf roots of graphs G, that is,
      the k-leaf roots of G with minimum k value. Thus, all k''-leaf roots of G satisfy
      k<= k''. In terms of computational biology, seeking optimal leaf roots is more
      justified as they yield more probable phylogenetic trees. Lafond''s result does
      not imply polynomial-time computability of optimal leaf roots, because, even
      for optimal k-leaf roots, k may (exponentially) depend on the size of G. This
      paper presents a linear-time construction of optimal leaf roots for chordal
      cographs (also known as trivially perfect graphs). Additionally, it highlights
      the importance of the parity of the parameter k and provides a deeper insight

      "Graphs are fundamental objects that find widespread applications across computer
      science and beyond. Graph Theory has yielded deep insights about structural
      properties of various families of graphs, which are leveraged in the design
      and analysis of algorithms for graph optimization problems and other computational
      optimization problems. These insights have also proved helpful in understanding
      the limits of efficient computation by providing constructions of hard problem
      instances. At the same time, algorithmic tools and techniques provide a fresh
      perspective on graph theoretic problems, often leading to novel discoveries.
      In this thesis, we exploit this symbiotic relationship between graph theory
      and algorithms for graph optimization problems and beyond. This thesis consists
      of three parts. In the first part, we study a graph routing problem called the
      Node-Disjoint Paths (NDP) problem. Given a graph and a set of source-destination
      pairs of its vertices, the goal is to route the maximum number of pairs via
      node-disjoint paths. We come close to resolving the approximability of NDP by
      showing that it is $n^{\\Omega(1/poly\\log\\log n)}$-hard to approximate, even
      on grid graphs, where n is the number of vertices. In the second part of this
      thesis, we use graph decomposition techniques developed for efficient algorithms
      to derive a graph theoretic result. We show that for every n-vertex expander
      graph G, if H is any graph with at most $O(n/\\log n)$ vertices and edges, then
      H is a minor of G. In the last part, we show that the graph theoretic tools
      and graph algorithmic techniques can shed light on problems seemingly unrelated
      to graphs. We show that the randomized space complexity of the Longest Increasing
      Subsequence (LIS) problem in the streaming model is intrinsically tied to the
      query-complexity of the Non-Crossing Matching problem on graphs in a new model
      of computation that we define.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

      the models and assessing the optimality of paths become more complicated. Hence,
      multiple recent publications in the field adapt existing labeling methods in
      an ad-hoc fashion to their specific problem variant without considering the
      underlying general structure: they always deal with multi-criteria scenarios
      and those criteria define different partial orders on the paths. In this paper,
      we introduce the partial order shortest path problem (POSP), a generalization
      of the multi-objective shortest path problem (MOSP) and in turn also of the
      classical shortest path problem. POSP captures the particular structure of many
      shortest path applications as special cases. In this generality, we study optimality

      is one of the most difficult problems defined as NP-hard. In this problem, it
      is aimed to determine the important nodes that can influence all nodes via the

      algorithm showing a deterministic approach has been developed different from
      the approximation algorithms mentioned in the literature for discovering dominating

      Set (DS). At the same time, the algorithm is an original algorithm whose solution
      is not random by using a fundamental cut-set. The DS algorithm consists of 3
      basic phases. In the first phase of the algorithm, the algorithm that constructs
      the special spanning tree (Karci Max tree) of the graph is developed. In the
      second phase, the algorithm that finds the fundamental cut sets using the Kmax
      spanning tree is developed. In the last phase, Karci centrality node values
      are calculated with fundamental cut set and by using these Karci centrality
      node values, an algorithm has been developed to identify DS nodes. As a result
      of these three phases, the dominance values of the nodes on the graph and the
      DS nodes are calculated. The detected Karci centrality node values give priority

      single-source unsplittable flow (SSUF) problem asks to send flow from a common
      source to different terminals with unrelated demands, each terminal being served
      through a single path. One of the most heavily studied SSUF objectives is to
      minimize the violation of some given arc capacities. A seminal result of Dinitz,
      Garg, and Goemans showed that, whenever a fractional flow exists respecting
      the capacities, then there is an unsplittable one violating the capacities by
      at most the maximum demand. Goemans conjectured a very natural cost version
      of the same result, where the unsplittable flow is required to be no more expensive
      than the fractional one. This intriguing conjecture remains open. More so, there
      are arguably no non-trivial graph classes for which it is known to hold. We
      show that a slight weakening of it (with at most twice as large violations)
      holds for planar graphs. Our result is based on a connection to a highly structured
      discrepancy problem, whose repeated resolution allows us to successively reduce
      the number of paths used for each terminal, until we obtain an unsplittable
      flow. Moreover, our techniques also extend to simultaneous upper and lower bounds

      criterion) is a common problem in graph theory and tree networks. This problem
      is open to study because its applications are growing and extending in different
      fields, such as providing insight for decision-makers when selecting the optimal
      location for non-emergency services, including railroad lines, highways, pipelines,
      and transit routes. Also, the min-sum criterion can deal with several networks
      in different applications. The location problem has traditionally been concerned
      with the optimal location of a single-point facility at either a vertex or along
      an edge in a network. Recently, numerous investigators have investigated this
      classic problem and have studied the location of many facilities, such as paths,
      trees, and cycles. The concept of the median, which measures the centrality
      of a vertex in a graph, is extended to the paths in a graph. In this paper,
      we consider the problem of locating path-shaped facilities on a tree network.
      A new modified and improved algorithm for finding a median single path facility
      of a specified length in a tree network is proposed. The median criterion for
      optimality considers the sum of the distances from all vertices of the tree
      to the path facility. This problem under the median criterion is called the
      \u2113-core problem. The distance between any two vertices in the tree is equal
      to the length of the unique path connecting them. This location problem usually
      has applications in distributed database systems, pipelines, the design of public
