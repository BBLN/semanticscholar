      "title": "Efficient Construction of Directed Hopsets and Parallel Single-source
      Shortest Paths (Abstract)", "abstract": "The single-source shortest-path problem
      is as follows: given a graph with nonnegative edge weights and a designated
      source vertex s, return the distances from~s to each other vertex such. This
      paper presents a randomized parallel single-source shortest paths (SSSP) algorithm
      for directed graphs with non-negative integer edge weights that solves the exact
      SSSP problem in O (m) work and n^1/2+o(1) span, with high probability. All previous
      exact SSSP algorithms with nearly linear work have linear span, even for undirected
      unweighted graphs. To solve exact SSSP problem, we first show a deterministic
      reduction from exact SSSP to directed hopsets using the iterative gradual rounding
      technique. An (\u03b2, \u03b5)-hopset is a set of weighted edges, also known
      as shortcuts, that when added to the graph, admit \u03b2-hop paths with weights
      no more than (1 + \u03b5) times the true shortest path distances. We show that
      (\u03b2, \u03b5)-hopsets can be used to solve the exact SSSP problem in O (m)
      work and O (\u03b2) span. Furthermore, we present the first nearly linear-work
      algorithm for constructing hopsets on directed graphs. Our sequential algorithm
      runs in O (m) time and constructs a hopset with O (n) edges and \u03b2 = n^1/2+o(1)
      . We also provide a parallel version of the algorithm with O (m) work and n^1/2+o(1)
      span. The directed hopsets can be used to solve approximate SSSP problems efficiently,
      where the objective is to return estimates of the distances from the source
      vertex to every other vertex such that the estimate falls between the true distance
      and (1+\u03b5) times the distance. Specifically, for constant \u03b5 and graphs
      with polynomially-bounded real edge weights, there is an algorithm solving approximate
      SSSP problem with O (m) work and n^1/2+o(1) span.", "venue": "HOPC@SPAA", "year":

      "title": "On Diameter Approximation in Directed Graphs", "abstract": "Computing
      the diameter of a graph, i.e. the largest distance, is a fundamental problem
      that is central in fine-grained complexity. In undirected graphs, the Strong
      Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) yields a lower bound on the time vs. approximation
      trade-off that is quite close to the upper bounds. In \\emph{directed} graphs,
      however, where only some of the upper bounds apply, much larger gaps remain.
      Since $d(u,v)$ may not be the same as $d(v,u)$, there are multiple ways to define
      the problem, the two most natural being the \\emph{(one-way) diameter} ($\\max_{(u,v)}
      d(u,v)$) and the \\emph{roundtrip diameter} ($\\max_{u,v} d(u,v)+d(v,u)$). In
      this paper we make progress on the outstanding open question for each of them.
      -- We design the first algorithm for diameter in sparse directed graphs to achieve
      $n^{1.5-\\varepsilon}$ time with an approximation factor better than $2$. The
      new upper bound trade-off makes the directed case appear more similar to the
      undirected case. Notably, this is the first algorithm for diameter in sparse
      graphs that benefits from fast matrix multiplication. -- We design new hardness
      reductions separating roundtrip diameter from directed and undirected diameter.
      In particular, a $1.5$-approximation in subquadratic time would refute the All-Nodes
      $k$-Cycle hypothesis, and any $(2-\\varepsilon)$-approximation would imply a
      breakthrough algorithm for approximate $\\ell_{\\infty}$-Closest-Pair. Notably,
      these are the first conditional lower bounds for diameter that are not based
      on SETH.", "venue": "Embedded Systems and Applications", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

      a shortest path between two nodes in an undirected unweighted graph is among
      the most basic algorithmic tasks. Breadth first search solves this problem in
      linear time, which is clearly also a lower bound in the worst case. However,
      several works have shown how to solve this problem in sublinear time in expectation
      when the input graph is drawn from one of several classes of random graphs.
      In this work, we extend these results by giving sublinear time shortest path
      (and short path) algorithms for expander graphs. We thus identify a natural
      deterministic property of a graph (that is satisfied by typical random regular
      graphs) which suffices for sublinear time shortest paths. The algorithms are
      very simple, involving only bidirectional breadth first search and short random
      walks. We also complement our new algorithms by near-matching lower bounds.",

      "title": "Improved Approximation Bounds for Minimum Weight Cycle in the CONGEST
      Model", "abstract": "Minimum Weight Cycle (MWC) is the problem of finding a
      simple cycle of minimum weight in a graph $G=(V,E)$. This is a fundamental graph
      problem with classical sequential algorithms that run in $\\tilde{O}(n^3)$ and
      $\\tilde{O}(mn)$ time where $n=|V|$ and $m=|E|$. In recent years this problem
      has received significant attention in the context of hardness through fine grained
      sequential complexity as well as in design of faster sequential approximation
      algorithms. For computing minimum weight cycle in the distributed CONGEST model,
      near-linear in $n$ lower and upper bounds on round complexity are known for
      directed graphs (weighted and unweighted), and for undirected weighted graphs;
      these lower bounds also apply to any $(2-\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm.
      This paper focuses on round complexity bounds for approximating MWC in the CONGEST
      model: For coarse approximations we show that for any constant $\\alpha>1$,
      computing an $\\alpha$-approximation of MWC requires $\\Omega (\\frac{\\sqrt

      for computing $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximate shortest paths from $k$ sources in

      "title": "The Unweighted and Weighted Reverse Shortest Path Problem for Disk
      Graphs", "abstract": "We study the reverse shortest path problem on disk graphs
      in the plane. In this problem we consider the proximity graph of a set of $n$
      disks in the plane of arbitrary radii: In this graph two disks are connected
      if the distance between them is at most some threshold parameter $r$. The case
      of intersection graphs is a special case with $r=0$. We give an algorithm that,
      given a target length $k$, computes the smallest value of $r$ for which there
      is a path of length at most $k$ between some given pair of disks in the proximity
      graph. Our algorithm runs in $O^*(n^{5/4})$ randomized expected time, which
      improves to $O^*(n^{6/5})$ for unit disk graphs, where all the disks have the
      same radius. Our technique is robust and can be applied to many variants of
      the problem. One significant variant is the case of weighted proximity graphs,
      where edges are assigned real weights equal to the distance between the disks
      or between their centers, and $k$ is replaced by a target weight $w$; that is,
      we seek a path whose length is at most $w$. In other variants, we want to optimize
      a parameter different from $r$, such as a scale factor of the radii of the disks.
      The main technique for the decision version of the problem (determining whether
      the graph with a given $r$ has the desired property) is based on efficient implementations
      of BFS (for the unweighted case) and of Dijkstra''s algorithm (for the weighted
      case), using efficient data structures for maintaining the bichromatic closest
      pair for certain bicliques and several distance functions. The optimization
      problem is then solved by combining the resulting decision procedure with enhanced
      variants of the interval shrinking and bifurcation technique of [4].", "venue":

      "title": "Are there graphs whose shortest path structure requires large edge
      weights?", "abstract": "The aspect ratio of a weighted graph $G$ is the ratio
      of its maximum edge weight to its minimum edge weight. Aspect ratio commonly
      arises as a complexity measure in graph algorithms, especially related to the
      computation of shortest paths. Popular paradigms are to interpolate between
      the settings of weighted and unweighted input graphs by incurring a dependence
      on aspect ratio, or by simply restricting attention to input graphs of low aspect
      ratio. This paper studies the effects of these paradigms, investigating whether
      graphs of low aspect ratio have more structured shortest paths than graphs in
      general. In particular, we raise the question of whether one can generally take
      a graph of large aspect ratio and \\emph{reweight} its edges, to obtain a graph
      with bounded aspect ratio while preserving the structure of its shortest paths.
      Our findings are: - Every weighted DAG on $n$ nodes has a shortest-paths preserving
      graph of aspect ratio $O(n)$. A simple lower bound shows that this is tight.
      - The previous result does not extend to general directed or undirected graphs;
      in fact, the answer turns out to be exponential in these settings. In particular,
      we construct directed and undirected $n$-node graphs for which any shortest-paths
      preserving graph has aspect ratio $2^{\\Omega(n)}$. We also consider the approximate
      version of this problem, where the goal is for shortest paths in $H$ to correspond
      to approximate shortest paths in $G$. We show that our exponential lower bounds
      extend even to this setting. We also show that in a closely related model, where
      approximate shortest paths in $H$ must also correspond to approximate shortest
      paths in $G$, even DAGs require exponential aspect ratio.", "venue": "arXiv.org",

      is $O(n^{2.032})$ time, using known bounds for rectangular matrix multiplication~$n^{\\omega(r)}$~[Le

      "abstract": "We consider the Shortest Odd Path problem, where given an undirected
      graph $G$, a weight function on its edges, and two vertices $s$ and $t$ in $G$,
      the aim is to find an $(s,t)$-path with odd length and, among all such paths,
      of minimum weight. For the case when the weight function is conservative, i.e.,
      when every cycle has non-negative total weight, the complexity of the Shortest
      Odd Path problem had been open for 20 years, and was recently shown to be NP-hard.
      We give a polynomial-time algorithm for the special case when the weight function
      is conservative and the set $E^-$ of negative-weight edges forms a single tree.
      Our algorithm exploits the strong connection between Shortest Odd Path and the
      problem of finding two internally vertex-disjoint paths between two terminals
      in an undirected edge-weighted graph. It also relies on solving an intermediary
      problem variant called Shortest Parity-Constrained Odd Path where for certain
      edges we have parity constraints on their position along the path. Also, we
      exhibit two FPT algorithms for solving Shortest Odd Path in graphs with conservative
      weight functions. The first FPT algorithm is parameterized by $|E^-|$, the number
      of negative edges, or more generally, by the maximum size of a matching in the
      subgraph of $G$ spanned by $E^-$. Our second FPT algorithm is parameterized
      by the treewidth of $G$.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

      we give the first efficient algorithms for the $k$-center problem on dynamic
      graphs undergoing edge updates. In this problem, the goal is to partition the
      input into $k$ sets by choosing $k$ centers such that the maximum distance from
      any data point to the closest center is minimized. It is known that it is NP-hard
      to get a better than $2$ approximation for this problem. While in many applications
      the input may naturally be modeled as a graph, all prior works on $k$-center
      problem in dynamic settings are on metrics. In this paper, we give a deterministic
      decremental $(2+\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm and a randomized incremental
      $(4+\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm, both with amortized update time $kn^{o(1)}$
      for weighted graphs. Moreover, we show a reduction that leads to a fully dynamic
      $(2+\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the $k$-center problem, with worst-case
      update time that is within a factor $k$ of the state-of-the-art upper bound
      for maintaining $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximate single-source distances in graphs.
      Matching this bound is a natural goalpost because the approximate distances
      of each vertex to its center can be used to maintain a $(2+\\epsilon)$-approximation
      of the graph diameter and the fastest known algorithms for such a diameter approximation
      also rely on maintaining approximate single-source distances.", "venue": "arXiv.org",

      dynamic algorithms in the model of algorithms with predictions. We assume the
      algorithm is given imperfect predictions regarding future updates, and we ask
      how such predictions can be used to improve the running time. This can be seen
      as a model interpolating between classic online and offline dynamic algorithms.
      Our results give smooth tradeoffs between these two extreme settings. First,
      we give algorithms for incremental and decremental transitive closure and approximate
      APSP that take as an additional input a predicted sequence of updates (edge
      insertions, or edge deletions, respectively). They preprocess it in $\\tilde{O}(n^{(3+\\omega)/2})$
      time, and then handle updates in $\\tilde{O}(1)$ worst-case time and queries
      in $\\tilde{O}(\\eta^2)$ worst-case time. Here $\\eta$ is an error measure that
      can be bounded by the maximum difference between the predicted and actual insertion
      (deletion) time of an edge, i.e., by the $\\ell_\\infty$-error of the predictions.
      The second group of results concerns fully dynamic problems with vertex updates,
      where the algorithm has access to a predicted sequence of the next $n$ updates.
      We show how to solve fully dynamic triangle detection, maximum matching, single-source
      reachability, and more, in $O(n^{\\omega-1}+n\\eta_i)$ worst-case update time.
      Here $\\eta_i$ denotes how much earlier the $i$-th update occurs than predicted.
      Our last result is a reduction that transforms a worst-case incremental algorithm
      without predictions into a fully dynamic algorithm which is given a predicted
      deletion time for each element at the time of its insertion. As a consequence
      we can, e.g., maintain fully dynamic exact APSP with such predictions in $\\tilde{O}(n^2)$
      worst-case vertex insertion time and $\\tilde{O}(n^2 (1+\\eta_i))$ worst-case
      vertex deletion time (for the prediction error $\\eta_i$ defined as above).",

      "title": "Feed Link Placement in Euclidean Graphs", "abstract": "We study the
      problem of connecting a new vertex p to a Euclidean graph G using k new edges,,
      called feed links which connect p to the boundary of the plane face f of G containing
      p . We aim to connect the vertex in such a way that the maximum dilation from
      p to a set of destination vertices in the graph is minimised, where we de\ufb01ne
      dilation as the ratio between the distance in the graph and Euclidean distance.
      Previous work mainly focus on reducing the dilation to points on the boundary
      of f rather than points anywhere in G . We give two di\ufb00erent methods to
      solve this problem in polynomial time for a \ufb01xed k . We show that the problem
      is NP-hard when k is not \ufb01xed by a reduction from set cover. We give three
      di\ufb00erent approximation algorithms that place k feed links such that the
      maximal dilation is approximated. The \ufb01rst algorithm gives a (1+ \u03b5
      )-approximation for arbitrarily small \u03b5 , however, its running time is
      still exponential in k . The second gives a ( t + 1)-approximation when f is
      a t -spanner and runs in O ( mn 2 log n ) time, where m denotes the number of
      vertices on the boundary of f and n denotes the total number of vertices in
      the graph. The third approximation algorithm also has a running time of O (
      mn 2 log n ) and is obtained after a comparison between dilation and distance
      in the context of feed link placement. Its approximation ratio depends on the
      di\ufb00erence in Euclidean distances between p and the destination vertices.",

      "title": "Exploring Shortest Paths on Large-scale networks", "abstract": "Networks,
      which are gaining much popularity in various disciplines, model connections
      between different real-world entities. Based on graph theory, we study a series
      of problems for understanding networks. Shortest path is among the most fundamental
      notions studied in graph theory. By exploring shortest path structure, we can
      better understand the connections between entities. However, it is often computationally
      expensive to compute shortest paths on large-scale networks which are common
      nowadays. This thesis addresses two problems on large-scale networks in relating
      to shortest paths: (1) How are two vertices connected in a graph? We first define
      the notion of shortest path graph which contains exactly all shortest paths
      between two vertices. This notion empowers us to make full use of shortest path
      structures for analysing the connection between vertices. We formalize the shortest-path-graph
      problem and propose a novel method, called Query-by-Sketch, which can efficiently
      leverage offline labelling to guide online searching through a fast-sketching
      process for solving the shortest-path-graph problem on complex networks. (2)
      How is one source vertex connected to other vertices in a graph? Enumerating
      all shortest paths between a source vertex and all other vertices is less informative
      due the fact that the number of shortest paths is excessive. In addition to
      this, coverage centrality fails to measure how influential a vertex is in the
      information flow from a source vertex. Thus we extend the notion of coverage
      centrality to relative coverage, to measure the importance a vertex is w.r.t
      a source vertex. Then we formalize the top-k relative coverage problem and develop
      an efficient method to answer top-k relative coverage queries in a reduced space,
      and design a bit-parallel optimization to speed up the computation of relative
      coverage. The thesis also theoretically discusses the complexity of proposed
      methods, and presents the experimental results of proposed methods using 12
      and 6 real-world datasets for two problems respectively, which illustrates the
      efficiency and scalability of proposed methods.", "venue": "", "year": 2021,

      "An $n$-vertex $m$-edge graph is \\emph{$k$-vertex connected} if it cannot be
      disconnected by deleting less than $k$ vertices. After more than half a century
      of intensive research, the result by [Li et al. STOC''21] finally gave a \\emph{randomized}
      algorithm for checking $k$-connectivity in near-optimal $\\widehat{O}(m)$ time.
      (We use $\\widehat{O}(\\cdot)$ to hide an $n^{o(1)}$ factor.) Deterministic
      algorithms, unfortunately, have remained much slower even if we assume a linear-time
      max-flow algorithm: they either require at least $\\Omega(mn)$ time [Even''75;
      Henzinger Rao and Gabow, FOCS''96; Gabow, FOCS''00] or assume that $k=o(\\sqrt{\\log
      n})$ [Saranurak and Yingchareonthawornchai, FOCS''22]. We show a \\emph{deterministic}
      algorithm for checking $k$-vertex connectivity in time proportional to making
      $\\widehat{O}(k^{2})$ max-flow calls, and, hence, in $\\widehat{O}(mk^{2})$
      time using the deterministic max-flow algorithm by [Brand et al. FOCS''23].
      Our algorithm gives the first almost-linear-time bound for all $k$ where $\\sqrt{\\log
      n}\\le k\\le n^{o(1)}$ and subsumes up to a sub polynomial factor the long-standing
      state-of-the-art algorithm by [Even''75] which requires $O(n+k^{2})$ max-flow
      calls. Our key technique is a deterministic algorithm for terminal reduction
      for vertex connectivity: given a terminal set separated by a vertex mincut,
      output either a vertex mincut or a smaller terminal set that remains separated
      by a vertex mincut. We also show a deterministic $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation
      algorithm for vertex connectivity that makes $O(n/\\epsilon^2)$ max-flow calls,
      improving the bound of $O(n^{1.5})$ max-flow calls in the exact algorithm of
      [Gabow, FOCS''00]. The technique is based on Ramanujan graphs.", "venue": "arXiv.org",

      Finding paths is a fundamental problem in graph theory and algorithm design

      temporal graphs, where edges may change over a discrete time domain. The analysis
      of graphs has also taken into account the relevance of vertex properties, modeled

      that, given a static or temporal graph, whose vertices are colored graph looks
      for a path such that (1) the vertices of the path have distinct colors and (2)
      that path includes the maximum number of colors. We analyze the approximation
      complexity of the problem on static and temporal graphs, and we prove an inapproximability

      "title": "Another Hamiltonian Cycle in Bipartite Pfaffian Graphs", "abstract":
      "We present a linear-time algorithm that, given as input (i) a bipartite Pfaffian
      graph $G$ of minimum degree three, (ii) a Hamiltonian cycle $H$ in $G$, and
      (iii) an edge $e$ in $H$, outputs at least three other Hamiltonian cycles through
      the edge $e$ in $G$. This linear-time complexity of finding another Hamiltonian
      cycle given one is in sharp contrast to the problem of deciding the existence
      of a Hamiltonian cycle, which is NP-complete already for cubic bipartite planar
      graphs; such graphs are Pfaffian. Also, without the degree requirement, we show
      that it is NP-hard to find another Hamiltonian cycle in a bipartite Pfaffian
      graph. We present further improved algorithms for finding optimal traveling
      salesperson tours and counting Hamiltonian cycles in bipartite planar graphs
      with running times that are not known to hold in general planar graphs. We prove
      our results by a new structural technique that efficiently witnesses each Hamiltonian
      cycle $H$ through an arbitrary fixed anchor edge $e$ in a bipartite Pfaffian
      graph using a two-coloring of the vertices as advice that is unique to $H$.
      Previous techniques -- the Cut&Count technique of Cygan et al. [FOCS''11, TALG''22]
      in particular -- were able to reduce the Hamiltonian cycle problem only to essentially
      counting problems; our results show that counting can be avoided by leveraging
      properties of bipartite Pfaffian graphs. Our technique also has purely graph-theoretical
      consequences; for example, we show that every cubic bipartite Pfaffian graph
      has either zero or at least six distinct Hamiltonian cycles; the latter case

      near-linear time approximation scheme for uncapacitated minimum cost flow in
      undirected graphs with real edge weights, a problem also known as transshipment.
      Specifically, our algorithm takes as input a (connected) undirected graph $G
      = (V, E)$, vertex demands $b \\in \\mathbb{R}^V$ such that $\\sum_{v \\in V}
      b(v) = 0$, positive edge costs $c \\in \\mathbb{R}_{>0}^E$, and a parameter
      $\\varepsilon>0$. In $O(\\varepsilon^{-2} m \\log^{O(1)} n)$ time, it returns
      a flow $f$ such that the net flow out of each vertex is equal to the vertex''s
      demand and the cost of the flow is within a $(1 + \\varepsilon)$ factor of optimal.
      Our algorithm is combinatorial and has no running time dependency on the demands
      or edge costs. With the exception of a recent result presented at STOC 2022
      for polynomially bounded edge weights, all almost- and near-linear time approximation
      schemes for transshipment relied on randomization in two main ways: 1) to embed
      the problem instance into low-dimensional space and 2) to randomly pick target
      locations to send flow so nearby opposing demands can be satisfied. Our algorithm
      instead deterministically approximates the cost of routing decisions that would
      be made if the input were subject to a random tree embedding. To avoid computing
      the $\\Omega(n^2)$ vertex-vertex distances that an approximation of this kind

      is to find a sequence of nodes from $V$, called a burning sequence, to burn
      the whole graph. This is a discrete-step process, and at each step, an unburned
      vertex is selected as an agent to spread fire to its neighbors by marking it
      as a burnt node. A burnt node spreads the fire to its neighbors at the next

      planar balanced shortest paths separator theorem. We prove that, in any n -vertex
      UDG G , one can \ufb01nd two hop-shortest paths P ( s, x ) and P ( s, y ) such
      that the removal of the 3-hop-neighborhood of these paths (i.e., N 3 G [ P (
      s, x ) \u222a P ( s, y )]) from G leaves no connected component with more than
      2 / 3 n vertices. This new balanced shortest-paths\u20143-hop-neighborhood separator
      theorem allows us to build, for any n -vertex UDG G , a system T ( G ) of at
      most 2 log 3 2 n + 2 spanning trees of G such that, for any two vertices x and
      y of G , there exists a tree T in T ( G ) with d T ( x, y ) \u2264 3 \u00b7
      d G ( x, y ) + 12. That is, the distances in any UDG can be approximately represented
      by the distances in at most 2 log 32 n + 2 of its spanning trees. Using these
      results, we propose a new compact and low delay routing labeling scheme for
      UDGs. They often model wireless ad hoc networks. We show that one can assign
      each vertex of an n -vertex UDG G a compact O (log 2 n )-bit label such that,
      given the label of a source vertex and the label of a destination, it is possible
      to compute e\ufb03ciently, based solely on these two labels, a neighbor of the
      source vertex that heads in the direction of the destination. We prove that
      this routing labeling scheme has a constant hop route-stretch (= hop delay ),
      i.e., for each two vertices x and y of G , it produces a routing path with h
      ( x, y ) hops (edges) such that h ( x, y ) \u2264 3 \u00b7 d G ( x, y ) + 12,
      where d G ( x, y ) is the hop distance between x and y in G . To the best of
      our knowledge, this is the \ufb01rst compact routing scheme for UDGs which not
      only guaranties delivery but has a low hop delay. It is easy to see that, for
      UDGs, a constant hop route-stretch implies a constant length route-stretch and
      a constant power route-stretch .", "venue": "", "year": 2008, "referenceCount":

      "title": "On Solving Reachability in Grid Digraphs using a Pseudoseparator",
      "abstract": ". The reachability problem asks to decide if there exists a path
      from one vertex to another in a digraph. In a grid digraph, the vertices are
      the points of a two-dimensional square grid, and an edge can occur between a
      vertex and its immediate horizontal and vertical neighbors only. Asano and Doerr
      (CCCG\u201911) presented the \ufb01rst simultaneous time-space bound for reachability
      in grid digraphs by solving the problem in polynomial time and \ud835\udc42
      ( \ud835\udc5b 1 / 2 + \ud835\udf16 ) space. In 2018, the space complexity was
      improved to \u02dc \ud835\udc42 ( \ud835\udc5b 1 / 3 ) by Ashida and Nakagawa
      (SoCG\u201918). In this paper, we show that there exists a polynomial-time algorithm
      that uses \ud835\udc42 ( \ud835\udc5b 1 / 4 + \ud835\udf16 ) space to solve
      the reachability problem in a grid digraph containing \ud835\udc5b vertices.
      We de\ufb01ne and construct a new separator-like device called pseudoseparator

      oracles, there are still large gaps between the best constructions for spanners

      This question remains a crucial area of investigation, and finding a positive

      "title": "Shortcut Partitions in Minor-Free Graphs: Steiner Point Removal, Distance
      Oracles, Tree Covers, and More", "abstract": "The notion of shortcut partition,
      introduced recently by Chang, Conroy, Le, Milenkovi\\''c, Solomon, and Than
      [CCLMST23], is a new type of graph partition into low-diameter clusters. Roughly
      speaking, the shortcut partition guarantees that for every two vertices $u$
      and $v$ in the graph, there exists a path between $u$ and $v$ that intersects
      only a few clusters. They proved that any planar graph admits a shortcut partition
      and gave several applications, including a construction of tree cover for arbitrary
      planar graphs with stretch $1+\\varepsilon$ and $O(1)$ many trees for any fixed
      $\\varepsilon \\in (0,1)$. However, the construction heavily exploits planarity
      in multiple steps, and is thus inherently limited to planar graphs. In this
      work, we breach the\"planarity barrier\"to construct a shortcut partition for
      $K_r$-minor-free graphs for any $r$. To this end, we take a completely different
      approach -- our key contribution is a novel deterministic variant of the cop
      decomposition in minor-free graphs [And86, AGG14]. Our shortcut partition for
      $K_r$-minor-free graphs yields several direct applications. Most notably, we
      construct the first optimal distance oracle for $K_r$-minor-free graphs, with
      $1+\\varepsilon$ stretch, linear space, and constant query time for any fixed
      $\\varepsilon \\in (0,1)$. The previous best distance oracle [AG06] uses $O(n\\log
      n)$ space and $O(\\log n)$ query time, and its construction relies on Robertson-Seymour
      structural theorem and other sophisticated tools. We also obtain the first tree
      cover of $O(1)$ size for minor-free graphs with stretch $1+\\varepsilon$, while
      the previous best $(1+\\varepsilon)$-tree cover has size $O(\\log^2 n)$ [BFN19].",

      \\subset V$ such that any two vertices $v_1,v_2 \\in \\mathcal{S}$ have no common
      neighbors. Finding a 2-packing set of maximum cardinality is a NP-hard problem.
      We develop a new approach to solve this problem on arbitrary graphs using its
      close relation to the independent set problem. Thereby, our algorithm red2pack
      uses new data reduction rules specific to the 2-packing set problem as well
      as a graph transformation. Our experiments show that we outperform the state-of-the-art
      for arbitrary graphs with respect to solution quality and also are able to compute
      solutions multiple orders of magnitude faster than previously possible. For
      example, we are able to solve 63% of our graphs to optimality in less than a
      second while the competitor for arbitrary graphs can only solve 5% of the graphs
      in the data set to optimality even with a 10 hour time limit. Moreover, our
      approach can solve a wide range of large instances that have previously been
      unsolved.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "referenceCount": 53, "citationCount":

      problem in graphs is fundamental to AI. Nearly all variants of the problem and

      Recently, a generalized framework for weighted directed graphs was suggested,
      where edge-weight can be computed (estimated) multiple times, at increasing
      accuracy and run-time expense. We build on this framework to introduce the problem
      of finding the tightest admissible shortest path (TASP); a path with the tightest
      suboptimality bound on the optimal cost. This is a generalization of the shortest
      path problem to bounded uncertainty, where edge-weight uncertainty can be traded
      for computational cost. We present a complete algorithm for solving TASP, with

      "title": "Counting Background Knowledge Consistent Markov Equivalent Directed
      Acyclic Graphs", "abstract": "Graphs and graph unions. We mostly follow the
      graph theory terminology of Andersson et al. [1997]. A graph is undirected if
      all its edges are undirected, directed if all its edges are directed, and partially
      directed if it contains both directed and undirected edges. A directed graph
      that has no directed cycle is called a directed acyclic graph (DAG). A generalization
      of this idea is that of chain graphs: a partially directed graph is called a
      chain graph if it has no cycle which contains (i) at least one directed edge,
      and (ii) in which all directed edges are directed in the same direction as one
      moves along the cycle. We denote the neighbors of a vertex v in a graph G as
      NG(v), and an induced subgraph of G on a set X \u2286 V is denoted as G[X].
      The graph union (which we just call \u201cunion\u201d) G1 \u222aG2 includes
      vertices and edges present in any one of G1 or G2, i.e., VG1\u222aG2 = VG1 \u222aVG2
      , and EG1\u222aG2 = EG1 \u222aEG2 . The skeleton of a partially directed graph
      G is an undirected version of G which we get by ignoring the direction of all
      the edges: in particular, note that the skeleton of a partially directed graph
      is also the graph union of all the partially directed graphs with the same skeleton
      as G. A v-structure (or unshielded collider) in a partially directed graph G
      is an ordered triple of vertices (a, b, c) of G which induce the subgraph a\u2192

      "abstract": "The widespread use of graph data in various applications and the
      highly dynamic nature of today''s networks have made it imperative to analyze
      structural trends in dynamic graphs on a continual basis. The shortest path
      is a fundamental concept in graph analysis and recent research shows that counting
      the number of shortest paths between two vertices is crucial in applications
      like potential friend recommendation and betweenness analysis. However, current
      studies that use hub labeling techniques for real-time shortest path counting
      are limited by their reliance on a pre-computed index, which cannot tackle frequent
      updates over dynamic graphs. To address this, we propose a novel approach for
      maintaining the index in response to changes in the graph structure and develop
      incremental (IncSPC) and decremental (DecSPC) update algorithms for inserting
      and deleting vertices/edges, respectively. The main idea of these two algorithms
      is that we only locate the affected vertices to update the index. Our experiments
      demonstrate that our dynamic algorithms are up to four orders of magnitude faster

      provide a complete comparison when restricted to $K_{t,t}$-subgraph-free graphs,
      showing in particular that treewidth, clique-width, mim-width, sim-width and
      tree-independence number are all equivalent. This extends a result of Gurski
      and Wanke (2000) stating that treewidth and clique-width are equivalent for
      the class of $K_{t,t}$-subgraph-free graphs. Next, we provide a complete comparison
      when restricted to line graphs, showing in particular that, on any class of
      line graphs, clique-width, mim-width, sim-width and tree-independence number
      are all equivalent, and bounded if and only if the class of root graphs has
      bounded treewidth. This extends a resut of Gurski and Wanke (2007) stating that
      a class of graphs~${\\cal G}$ has bounded treewidth if and only if the class
      of line graphs of graphs in ${\\cal G}$ has bounded clique-width. We then provide
      an almost-complete comparison for $K_{t,t}$-free graphs, leaving one missing
      case. Our main result is that $K_{t,t}$-free graphs of bounded mim-width have
      bounded tree-independence number. This result has structural and algorithmic
      consequences. In particular, it proves a special case of a conjecture of Dallard,
      Milani\\v{c} and \\v{S}torgel. Finally, we consider the question of whether
      boundedness of a certain width parameter is preserved under graph powers. We
      show that the question has a positive answer for sim-width precisely in the
      case of odd powers.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

      no other induced matching in G contains M. In the proposed game, players alternate
      choose edges on a graph while maintaining an induced matching. They continue
      until the matching is maximal (i.e. no player can choose another edge), and
      the last player to choose an edge wins. This paper will discuss patterns for
      this game and prove results on several categories of graphs including Complete

      we are given an $n$-node, $m$-edge input graph $G$, and the goal is to compute
      a spanning subgraph $H$ on $O(n)$ edges. This can be achieved in linear $O(m
      + n)$ time via breadth-first search. But can we hope for \\emph{sublinear} runtime
      in some range of parameters? If the goal is to return $H$ as an adjacency list,
      there are simple lower bounds showing that $\\Omega(m + n)$ runtime is necessary.
      If the goal is to return $H$ as an adjacency matrix, then we need $\\Omega(n^2)$
      time just to write down the entries of the output matrix. However, we show that
      neither of these lower bounds still apply if instead the goal is to return $H$
      as an \\emph{implicit} adjacency matrix, which we call an \\emph{adjacency oracle}.
      An adjacency oracle is a data structure that gives a user the illusion that
      an adjacency matrix has been computed: it accepts edge queries $(u, v)$, and
      it returns in near-constant time a bit indicating whether $(u, v) \\in E(H)$.
      Our main result is that one can construct an adjacency oracle for a spanning
      subgraph on at most $(1+\\varepsilon)n$ edges, in $\\tilde{O}(n \\varepsilon^{-1})$
      time, and that this construction time is near-optimal. Additional results include
      constructions of adjacency oracles for $k$-connectivity certificates and spanners,
      which are similarly sublinear on dense-enough input graphs. Our adjacency oracles
      are closely related to Local Computation Algorithms (LCAs) for graph sparsifiers;
      they can be viewed as LCAs with some computation moved to a preprocessing step,
      in order to speed up queries. Our oracles imply the first Local algorithm for
      computing sparse spanning subgraphs of general input graphs in $\\tilde{O}(n)$
      query time, which works by constructing our adjacency oracle, querying it once,
      and then throwing the rest of the oracle away. This addresses an open problem

      a graph $G$, the $k$-hop dominating set problem asks for a vertex subset $D_k$

      ($k\\in \\mathbb{N}$). For $k=1$, this corresponds to the classical dominating

      of this problem is 3 in grid graphs without holes, and 4 in general grid graphs.
      Furthermore, we provide a reduction from planar monotone 3SAT, thereby showing
      that the problem is NP-complete even in thin grid graphs (i.e., grid graphs
      that do not a contain an induced $C_4$). Complementary, we present a linear-time

      such that $||A|-|B|| \\le 1$ and the number $k$ of edges between $A$ and $B$
      is minimized. This problem can be viewed as a clustering problem where edges
      represent similarity, and the task is to partition the vertices into two equally
      sized clusters, while minimizing the number of pairs of similar objects that
      end up in different clusters. In this paper, we initiate the study of a fair
      version of Minimum Bisection. In this problem, the vertices of the graph are
      colored using one of $c \\ge 1$ colors. The goal is to find a bisection $(A,
      B)$ with at most $k$ edges between the parts, such that for each color $i\\in

      is $W$[1]-hard parameterized by $c$ even when $k = 0$. On the other hand, our

      "title": "Tight Approximations for Graphical House Allocation", "abstract":
      "The Graphical House Allocation (GHA) problem asks: how can $n$ houses (each
      with a fixed non-negative value) be assigned to the vertices of an undirected
      graph $G$, so as to minimize the sum of absolute differences along the edges
      of $G$? This problem generalizes the classical Minimum Linear Arrangement problem,
      as well as the well-known House Allocation Problem from Economics. Recent work
      has studied the computational aspects of GHA and observed that the problem is
      NP-hard and inapproximable even on particularly simple classes of graphs, such
      as vertex disjoint unions of paths. However, the dependence of any approximations
      on the structural properties of the underlying graph had not been studied. In
      this work, we give a nearly complete characterization of the approximability
      of GHA. We present algorithms to approximate the optimal envy on general graphs,
      trees, planar graphs, bounded-degree graphs, and bounded-degree planar graphs.
      For each of these graph classes, we then prove matching lower bounds, showing
      that in each case, no significant improvement can be attained unless P = NP.
      We also present general approximation ratios as a function of structural parameters
      of the underlying graph, such as treewidth; these match the tight upper bounds
      in general, and are significantly better approximations for many natural subclasses
      of graphs. Finally, we investigate the special case of bounded-degree trees
      in some detail. We first refute a conjecture by Hosseini et al. [2023] about
      the structural properties of exact optimal allocations on binary trees by means
      of a counterexample on a depth-$3$ complete binary tree. This refutation, together
      with our hardness results on trees, might suggest that approximating the optimal
      envy even on complete binary trees is infeasible. Nevertheless, we present a
      linear-time algorithm that attains a $3$-approximation on complete binary trees.",

      of the multi-objective shortest path problem (MOSP) and in turn also of the
      classical shortest path problem. POSP captures the particular structure of many
      shortest path applications as special cases. In this generality, we study optimality
      conditions or the lack of them, depending on the objective functions'' properties.
      Our final contribution is a big lookup table summarizing our findings and providing
      the reader an easy way to choose among the most recent multicriteria shortest
      path algorithms depending on their problem''s weight structure. Examples range
      from time-dependent shortest path and bottleneck path problems to the fuzzy
      shortest path problem and complex financial weight functions studied in the
      public transportation community. Our results hold for general digraphs and therefore
      surpass previous generalizations that were limited to acyclic graphs.", "venue":

      showing that USTs are equivalent to strong sparse partition hierarchies (up

      algorithms for computing both $O(\\log ^ 7 n)$-approximate USTs and poly-logarithmic
      strong sparse partition hierarchies. For graphs with constant doubling dimension

      $k$ input graphs $G_1, \\dots ,G_k$, where each pair $G_i$, $G_j$ with $i \\neq
      j$ shares the same graph $G$, the problem Simultaneous Embedding With Fixed
      Edges (SEFE) asks whether there exists a planar drawing for each input graph
      such that all drawings coincide on $G$. While SEFE is still open for the case
      of two input graphs, the problem is NP-complete for $k \\geq 3$ [Schaefer, JGAA
      13]. In this work, we explore the parameterized complexity of SEFE. We show
      that SEFE is FPT with respect to $k$ plus the vertex cover number or the feedback
      edge set number of the the union graph $G^\\cup = G_1 \\cup \\dots \\cup G_k$.
      Regarding the shared graph $G$, we show that SEFE is NP-complete, even if $G$
      is a tree with maximum degree 4. Together with a known NP-hardness reduction
      [Angelini et al., TCS 15], this allows us to conclude that several parameters
      of $G$, including the maximum degree, the maximum number of degree-1 neighbors,
      the vertex cover number, and the number of cutvertices are intractable. We also
      settle the tractability of all pairs of these parameters. We give FPT algorithms
      for the vertex cover number plus either of the first two parameters and for
      the number of cutvertices plus the maximum degree, whereas we prove all remaining
      combinations to be intractable.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

      "abstract": "A graph G is a k-leaf power, for an integer k>= 2, if there is
      a tree T with leaf set V(G) such that, for all vertices x, y in V(G), the edge
      xy exists in G if and only if the distance between x and y in T is at most k.
      Such a tree T is called a k-leaf root of G. The computational problem of constructing
      a k-leaf root for a given graph G and an integer k, if any, is motivated by
      the challenge from computational biology to reconstruct phylogenetic trees.
      For fixed k, Lafond [SODA 2022] recently solved this problem in polynomial time.
      In this paper, we propose to study optimal leaf roots of graphs G, that is,
      the k-leaf roots of G with minimum k value. Thus, all k''-leaf roots of G satisfy
      k<= k''. In terms of computational biology, seeking optimal leaf roots is more
      justified as they yield more probable phylogenetic trees. Lafond''s result does
      not imply polynomial-time computability of optimal leaf roots, because, even
      for optimal k-leaf roots, k may (exponentially) depend on the size of G. This
      paper presents a linear-time construction of optimal leaf roots for chordal
      cographs (also known as trivially perfect graphs). Additionally, it highlights
      the importance of the parity of the parameter k and provides a deeper insight

      "title": "Graph Theory and its Uses in Graph Algorithms and Beyond", "abstract":
      "Graphs are fundamental objects that find widespread applications across computer
      science and beyond. Graph Theory has yielded deep insights about structural
      properties of various families of graphs, which are leveraged in the design
      and analysis of algorithms for graph optimization problems and other computational
      optimization problems. These insights have also proved helpful in understanding
      the limits of efficient computation by providing constructions of hard problem
      instances. At the same time, algorithmic tools and techniques provide a fresh
      perspective on graph theoretic problems, often leading to novel discoveries.
      In this thesis, we exploit this symbiotic relationship between graph theory
      and algorithms for graph optimization problems and beyond. This thesis consists
      of three parts. In the first part, we study a graph routing problem called the
      Node-Disjoint Paths (NDP) problem. Given a graph and a set of source-destination
      pairs of its vertices, the goal is to route the maximum number of pairs via
      node-disjoint paths. We come close to resolving the approximability of NDP by
      showing that it is $n^{\\Omega(1/poly\\log\\log n)}$-hard to approximate, even
      on grid graphs, where n is the number of vertices. In the second part of this
      thesis, we use graph decomposition techniques developed for efficient algorithms
      to derive a graph theoretic result. We show that for every n-vertex expander
      graph G, if H is any graph with at most $O(n/\\log n)$ vertices and edges, then
      H is a minor of G. In the last part, we show that the graph theoretic tools
      and graph algorithmic techniques can shed light on problems seemingly unrelated
      to graphs. We show that the randomized space complexity of the Longest Increasing
      Subsequence (LIS) problem in the streaming model is intrinsically tied to the
      query-complexity of the Non-Crossing Matching problem on graphs in a new model
      of computation that we define.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

      the models and assessing the optimality of paths become more complicated. Hence,
      multiple recent publications in the field adapt existing labeling methods in
      an ad-hoc fashion to their specific problem variant without considering the
      underlying general structure: they always deal with multi-criteria scenarios
      and those criteria define different partial orders on the paths. In this paper,
      we introduce the partial order shortest path problem (POSP), a generalization
      of the multi-objective shortest path problem (MOSP) and in turn also of the
      classical shortest path problem. POSP captures the particular structure of many
      shortest path applications as special cases. In this generality, we study optimality
      conditions or the lack of them, depending on the objective functions'' properties.
      Our final contribution is a big lookup table summarizing our findings and providing

      Shortest Paths (Abstract)", "abstract": "The single-source shortest-path problem
      is as follows: given a graph with nonnegative edge weights and a designated
      source vertex s, return the distances from~s to each other vertex such. This
      paper presents a randomized parallel single-source shortest paths (SSSP) algorithm
      for directed graphs with non-negative integer edge weights that solves the exact
      SSSP problem in O (m) work and n^1/2+o(1) span, with high probability. All previous
      exact SSSP algorithms with nearly linear work have linear span, even for undirected
      unweighted graphs. To solve exact SSSP problem, we first show a deterministic
      reduction from exact SSSP to directed hopsets using the iterative gradual rounding
      technique. An (\u03b2, \u03b5)-hopset is a set of weighted edges, also known
      as shortcuts, that when added to the graph, admit \u03b2-hop paths with weights
      no more than (1 + \u03b5) times the true shortest path distances. We show that
      (\u03b2, \u03b5)-hopsets can be used to solve the exact SSSP problem in O (m)
      work and O (\u03b2) span. Furthermore, we present the first nearly linear-work
      algorithm for constructing hopsets on directed graphs. Our sequential algorithm
      runs in O (m) time and constructs a hopset with O (n) edges and \u03b2 = n^1/2+o(1)
      . We also provide a parallel version of the algorithm with O (m) work and n^1/2+o(1)
      span. The directed hopsets can be used to solve approximate SSSP problems efficiently,
      where the objective is to return estimates of the distances from the source
      vertex to every other vertex such that the estimate falls between the true distance
      and (1+\u03b5) times the distance. Specifically, for constant \u03b5 and graphs
      with polynomially-bounded real edge weights, there is an algorithm solving approximate
      SSSP problem with O (m) work and n^1/2+o(1) span.", "venue": "HOPC@SPAA", "year":

      "title": "On Diameter Approximation in Directed Graphs", "abstract": "Computing
      the diameter of a graph, i.e. the largest distance, is a fundamental problem
      that is central in fine-grained complexity. In undirected graphs, the Strong
      Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) yields a lower bound on the time vs. approximation
      trade-off that is quite close to the upper bounds. In \\emph{directed} graphs,
      however, where only some of the upper bounds apply, much larger gaps remain.
      Since $d(u,v)$ may not be the same as $d(v,u)$, there are multiple ways to define
      the problem, the two most natural being the \\emph{(one-way) diameter} ($\\max_{(u,v)}
      d(u,v)$) and the \\emph{roundtrip diameter} ($\\max_{u,v} d(u,v)+d(v,u)$). In
      this paper we make progress on the outstanding open question for each of them.
      -- We design the first algorithm for diameter in sparse directed graphs to achieve
      $n^{1.5-\\varepsilon}$ time with an approximation factor better than $2$. The
      new upper bound trade-off makes the directed case appear more similar to the
      undirected case. Notably, this is the first algorithm for diameter in sparse
      graphs that benefits from fast matrix multiplication. -- We design new hardness
      reductions separating roundtrip diameter from directed and undirected diameter.
      In particular, a $1.5$-approximation in subquadratic time would refute the All-Nodes
      $k$-Cycle hypothesis, and any $(2-\\varepsilon)$-approximation would imply a
      breakthrough algorithm for approximate $\\ell_{\\infty}$-Closest-Pair. Notably,
      these are the first conditional lower bounds for diameter that are not based
      on SETH.", "venue": "Embedded Systems and Applications", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

      a shortest path between two nodes in an undirected unweighted graph is among
      the most basic algorithmic tasks. Breadth first search solves this problem in
      linear time, which is clearly also a lower bound in the worst case. However,
      several works have shown how to solve this problem in sublinear time in expectation
      when the input graph is drawn from one of several classes of random graphs.
      In this work, we extend these results by giving sublinear time shortest path
      (and short path) algorithms for expander graphs. We thus identify a natural
      deterministic property of a graph (that is satisfied by typical random regular
      graphs) which suffices for sublinear time shortest paths. The algorithms are
      very simple, involving only bidirectional breadth first search and short random
      walks. We also complement our new algorithms by near-matching lower bounds.",

      "title": "Improved Approximation Bounds for Minimum Weight Cycle in the CONGEST
      Model", "abstract": "Minimum Weight Cycle (MWC) is the problem of finding a
      simple cycle of minimum weight in a graph $G=(V,E)$. This is a fundamental graph
      problem with classical sequential algorithms that run in $\\tilde{O}(n^3)$ and
      $\\tilde{O}(mn)$ time where $n=|V|$ and $m=|E|$. In recent years this problem
      has received significant attention in the context of hardness through fine grained
      sequential complexity as well as in design of faster sequential approximation
      algorithms. For computing minimum weight cycle in the distributed CONGEST model,
      near-linear in $n$ lower and upper bounds on round complexity are known for
      directed graphs (weighted and unweighted), and for undirected weighted graphs;
      these lower bounds also apply to any $(2-\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm.
      This paper focuses on round complexity bounds for approximating MWC in the CONGEST
      model: For coarse approximations we show that for any constant $\\alpha>1$,
      computing an $\\alpha$-approximation of MWC requires $\\Omega (\\frac{\\sqrt

      "title": "The Unweighted and Weighted Reverse Shortest Path Problem for Disk
      Graphs", "abstract": "We study the reverse shortest path problem on disk graphs
      in the plane. In this problem we consider the proximity graph of a set of $n$
      disks in the plane of arbitrary radii: In this graph two disks are connected
      if the distance between them is at most some threshold parameter $r$. The case
      of intersection graphs is a special case with $r=0$. We give an algorithm that,
      given a target length $k$, computes the smallest value of $r$ for which there
      is a path of length at most $k$ between some given pair of disks in the proximity
      graph. Our algorithm runs in $O^*(n^{5/4})$ randomized expected time, which
      improves to $O^*(n^{6/5})$ for unit disk graphs, where all the disks have the
      same radius. Our technique is robust and can be applied to many variants of
      the problem. One significant variant is the case of weighted proximity graphs,
      where edges are assigned real weights equal to the distance between the disks
      or between their centers, and $k$ is replaced by a target weight $w$; that is,
      we seek a path whose length is at most $w$. In other variants, we want to optimize
      a parameter different from $r$, such as a scale factor of the radii of the disks.
      The main technique for the decision version of the problem (determining whether
      the graph with a given $r$ has the desired property) is based on efficient implementations
      of BFS (for the unweighted case) and of Dijkstra''s algorithm (for the weighted
      case), using efficient data structures for maintaining the bichromatic closest
      pair for certain bicliques and several distance functions. The optimization
      problem is then solved by combining the resulting decision procedure with enhanced
      variants of the interval shrinking and bifurcation technique of [4].", "venue":

      "title": "Are there graphs whose shortest path structure requires large edge
      weights?", "abstract": "The aspect ratio of a weighted graph $G$ is the ratio
      of its maximum edge weight to its minimum edge weight. Aspect ratio commonly
      arises as a complexity measure in graph algorithms, especially related to the
      computation of shortest paths. Popular paradigms are to interpolate between
      the settings of weighted and unweighted input graphs by incurring a dependence
      on aspect ratio, or by simply restricting attention to input graphs of low aspect
      ratio. This paper studies the effects of these paradigms, investigating whether
      graphs of low aspect ratio have more structured shortest paths than graphs in
      general. In particular, we raise the question of whether one can generally take
      a graph of large aspect ratio and \\emph{reweight} its edges, to obtain a graph
      with bounded aspect ratio while preserving the structure of its shortest paths.
      Our findings are: - Every weighted DAG on $n$ nodes has a shortest-paths preserving
      graph of aspect ratio $O(n)$. A simple lower bound shows that this is tight.
      - The previous result does not extend to general directed or undirected graphs;
      in fact, the answer turns out to be exponential in these settings. In particular,
      we construct directed and undirected $n$-node graphs for which any shortest-paths
      preserving graph has aspect ratio $2^{\\Omega(n)}$. We also consider the approximate
      version of this problem, where the goal is for shortest paths in $H$ to correspond
      to approximate shortest paths in $G$. We show that our exponential lower bounds
      extend even to this setting. We also show that in a closely related model, where
      approximate shortest paths in $H$ must also correspond to approximate shortest
      paths in $G$, even DAGs require exponential aspect ratio.", "venue": "arXiv.org",

      is $O(n^{2.032})$ time, using known bounds for rectangular matrix multiplication~$n^{\\omega(r)}$~[Le

      "abstract": "We consider the Shortest Odd Path problem, where given an undirected
      graph $G$, a weight function on its edges, and two vertices $s$ and $t$ in $G$,
      the aim is to find an $(s,t)$-path with odd length and, among all such paths,
      of minimum weight. For the case when the weight function is conservative, i.e.,
      when every cycle has non-negative total weight, the complexity of the Shortest
      Odd Path problem had been open for 20 years, and was recently shown to be NP-hard.
      We give a polynomial-time algorithm for the special case when the weight function
      is conservative and the set $E^-$ of negative-weight edges forms a single tree.
      Our algorithm exploits the strong connection between Shortest Odd Path and the
      problem of finding two internally vertex-disjoint paths between two terminals
      in an undirected edge-weighted graph. It also relies on solving an intermediary
      problem variant called Shortest Parity-Constrained Odd Path where for certain
      edges we have parity constraints on their position along the path. Also, we
      exhibit two FPT algorithms for solving Shortest Odd Path in graphs with conservative
      weight functions. The first FPT algorithm is parameterized by $|E^-|$, the number
      of negative edges, or more generally, by the maximum size of a matching in the
      subgraph of $G$ spanned by $E^-$. Our second FPT algorithm is parameterized
      by the treewidth of $G$.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

      we give the first efficient algorithms for the $k$-center problem on dynamic
      graphs undergoing edge updates. In this problem, the goal is to partition the
      input into $k$ sets by choosing $k$ centers such that the maximum distance from
      any data point to the closest center is minimized. It is known that it is NP-hard
      to get a better than $2$ approximation for this problem. While in many applications
      the input may naturally be modeled as a graph, all prior works on $k$-center
      problem in dynamic settings are on metrics. In this paper, we give a deterministic
      decremental $(2+\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm and a randomized incremental
      $(4+\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm, both with amortized update time $kn^{o(1)}$
      for weighted graphs. Moreover, we show a reduction that leads to a fully dynamic
      $(2+\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the $k$-center problem, with worst-case
      update time that is within a factor $k$ of the state-of-the-art upper bound
      for maintaining $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximate single-source distances in graphs.
      Matching this bound is a natural goalpost because the approximate distances
      of each vertex to its center can be used to maintain a $(2+\\epsilon)$-approximation
      of the graph diameter and the fastest known algorithms for such a diameter approximation
      also rely on maintaining approximate single-source distances.", "venue": "arXiv.org",

      "title": "On Dynamic Graph Algorithms with Predictions", "abstract": "We study
      dynamic algorithms in the model of algorithms with predictions. We assume the
      algorithm is given imperfect predictions regarding future updates, and we ask
      how such predictions can be used to improve the running time. This can be seen
      as a model interpolating between classic online and offline dynamic algorithms.
      Our results give smooth tradeoffs between these two extreme settings. First,
      we give algorithms for incremental and decremental transitive closure and approximate
      APSP that take as an additional input a predicted sequence of updates (edge
      insertions, or edge deletions, respectively). They preprocess it in $\\tilde{O}(n^{(3+\\omega)/2})$
      time, and then handle updates in $\\tilde{O}(1)$ worst-case time and queries
      in $\\tilde{O}(\\eta^2)$ worst-case time. Here $\\eta$ is an error measure that
      can be bounded by the maximum difference between the predicted and actual insertion
      (deletion) time of an edge, i.e., by the $\\ell_\\infty$-error of the predictions.
      The second group of results concerns fully dynamic problems with vertex updates,
      where the algorithm has access to a predicted sequence of the next $n$ updates.
      We show how to solve fully dynamic triangle detection, maximum matching, single-source
      reachability, and more, in $O(n^{\\omega-1}+n\\eta_i)$ worst-case update time.
      Here $\\eta_i$ denotes how much earlier the $i$-th update occurs than predicted.
      Our last result is a reduction that transforms a worst-case incremental algorithm
      without predictions into a fully dynamic algorithm which is given a predicted
      deletion time for each element at the time of its insertion. As a consequence
      we can, e.g., maintain fully dynamic exact APSP with such predictions in $\\tilde{O}(n^2)$
      worst-case vertex insertion time and $\\tilde{O}(n^2 (1+\\eta_i))$ worst-case
      vertex deletion time (for the prediction error $\\eta_i$ defined as above).",

      problem of connecting a new vertex p to a Euclidean graph G using k new edges,,
      called feed links which connect p to the boundary of the plane face f of G containing
      p . We aim to connect the vertex in such a way that the maximum dilation from
      p to a set of destination vertices in the graph is minimised, where we de\ufb01ne
      dilation as the ratio between the distance in the graph and Euclidean distance.
      Previous work mainly focus on reducing the dilation to points on the boundary
      of f rather than points anywhere in G . We give two di\ufb00erent methods to
      solve this problem in polynomial time for a \ufb01xed k . We show that the problem
      is NP-hard when k is not \ufb01xed by a reduction from set cover. We give three
      di\ufb00erent approximation algorithms that place k feed links such that the
      maximal dilation is approximated. The \ufb01rst algorithm gives a (1+ \u03b5
      )-approximation for arbitrarily small \u03b5 , however, its running time is
      still exponential in k . The second gives a ( t + 1)-approximation when f is
      a t -spanner and runs in O ( mn 2 log n ) time, where m denotes the number of
      vertices on the boundary of f and n denotes the total number of vertices in
      the graph. The third approximation algorithm also has a running time of O (
      mn 2 log n ) and is obtained after a comparison between dilation and distance
      in the context of feed link placement. Its approximation ratio depends on the
      di\ufb00erence in Euclidean distances between p and the destination vertices.",

      "title": "Exploring Shortest Paths on Large-scale networks", "abstract": "Networks,
      which are gaining much popularity in various disciplines, model connections
      between different real-world entities. Based on graph theory, we study a series
      of problems for understanding networks. Shortest path is among the most fundamental
      notions studied in graph theory. By exploring shortest path structure, we can
      better understand the connections between entities. However, it is often computationally
      expensive to compute shortest paths on large-scale networks which are common
      nowadays. This thesis addresses two problems on large-scale networks in relating
      to shortest paths: (1) How are two vertices connected in a graph? We first define
      the notion of shortest path graph which contains exactly all shortest paths
      between two vertices. This notion empowers us to make full use of shortest path
      structures for analysing the connection between vertices. We formalize the shortest-path-graph
      problem and propose a novel method, called Query-by-Sketch, which can efficiently
      leverage offline labelling to guide online searching through a fast-sketching
      process for solving the shortest-path-graph problem on complex networks. (2)
      How is one source vertex connected to other vertices in a graph? Enumerating
      all shortest paths between a source vertex and all other vertices is less informative
      due the fact that the number of shortest paths is excessive. In addition to
      this, coverage centrality fails to measure how influential a vertex is in the
      information flow from a source vertex. Thus we extend the notion of coverage
      centrality to relative coverage, to measure the importance a vertex is w.r.t
      a source vertex. Then we formalize the top-k relative coverage problem and develop
      an efficient method to answer top-k relative coverage queries in a reduced space,
      and design a bit-parallel optimization to speed up the computation of relative
      coverage. The thesis also theoretically discusses the complexity of proposed
      methods, and presents the experimental results of proposed methods using 12
      and 6 real-world datasets for two problems respectively, which illustrates the
      efficiency and scalability of proposed methods.", "venue": "", "year": 2021,

      "An $n$-vertex $m$-edge graph is \\emph{$k$-vertex connected} if it cannot be

      of intensive research, the result by [Li et al. STOC''21] finally gave a \\emph{randomized}
      algorithm for checking $k$-connectivity in near-optimal $\\widehat{O}(m)$ time.
      (We use $\\widehat{O}(\\cdot)$ to hide an $n^{o(1)}$ factor.) Deterministic
      algorithms, unfortunately, have remained much slower even if we assume a linear-time
      max-flow algorithm: they either require at least $\\Omega(mn)$ time [Even''75;
      Henzinger Rao and Gabow, FOCS''96; Gabow, FOCS''00] or assume that $k=o(\\sqrt{\\log

      of graphs has also taken into account the relevance of vertex properties, modeled

      that path includes the maximum number of colors. We analyze the approximation

      "We present a linear-time algorithm that, given as input (i) a bipartite Pfaffian
      graph $G$ of minimum degree three, (ii) a Hamiltonian cycle $H$ in $G$, and
      (iii) an edge $e$ in $H$, outputs at least three other Hamiltonian cycles through
      the edge $e$ in $G$. This linear-time complexity of finding another Hamiltonian
      cycle given one is in sharp contrast to the problem of deciding the existence
      of a Hamiltonian cycle, which is NP-complete already for cubic bipartite planar
      graphs; such graphs are Pfaffian. Also, without the degree requirement, we show
      that it is NP-hard to find another Hamiltonian cycle in a bipartite Pfaffian
      graph. We present further improved algorithms for finding optimal traveling
      salesperson tours and counting Hamiltonian cycles in bipartite planar graphs
      with running times that are not known to hold in general planar graphs. We prove
      our results by a new structural technique that efficiently witnesses each Hamiltonian
      cycle $H$ through an arbitrary fixed anchor edge $e$ in a bipartite Pfaffian
      graph using a two-coloring of the vertices as advice that is unique to $H$.
      Previous techniques -- the Cut&Count technique of Cygan et al. [FOCS''11, TALG''22]
      in particular -- were able to reduce the Hamiltonian cycle problem only to essentially
      counting problems; our results show that counting can be avoided by leveraging
      properties of bipartite Pfaffian graphs. Our technique also has purely graph-theoretical
      consequences; for example, we show that every cubic bipartite Pfaffian graph
      has either zero or at least six distinct Hamiltonian cycles; the latter case

      near-linear time approximation scheme for uncapacitated minimum cost flow in
      undirected graphs with real edge weights, a problem also known as transshipment.
      Specifically, our algorithm takes as input a (connected) undirected graph $G
      = (V, E)$, vertex demands $b \\in \\mathbb{R}^V$ such that $\\sum_{v \\in V}
      b(v) = 0$, positive edge costs $c \\in \\mathbb{R}_{>0}^E$, and a parameter

      a flow $f$ such that the net flow out of each vertex is equal to the vertex''s
      demand and the cost of the flow is within a $(1 + \\varepsilon)$ factor of optimal.
      Our algorithm is combinatorial and has no running time dependency on the demands
      or edge costs. With the exception of a recent result presented at STOC 2022
      for polynomially bounded edge weights, all almost- and near-linear time approximation
      schemes for transshipment relied on randomization in two main ways: 1) to embed
      the problem instance into low-dimensional space and 2) to randomly pick target
      locations to send flow so nearby opposing demands can be satisfied. Our algorithm
      instead deterministically approximates the cost of routing decisions that would
      be made if the input were subject to a random tree embedding. To avoid computing
      the $\\Omega(n^2)$ vertex-vertex distances that an approximation of this kind

      is to find a sequence of nodes from $V$, called a burning sequence, to burn
      the whole graph. This is a discrete-step process, and at each step, an unburned
      vertex is selected as an agent to spread fire to its neighbors by marking it
      as a burnt node. A burnt node spreads the fire to its neighbors at the next
      consecutive step. The goal is to find the burning sequence of minimum length.
      The Graph Burning problem is NP-Hard for general graphs and even for binary
      trees. A few approximation results are known, including a $ 3$-approximation
      algorithm for general graphs and a $ 2$-approximation algorithm for trees. The
      Graph Burning on directed graphs is more challenging than on undirected graphs.

      "title": "Balanced Separator Theorem for Unit Disk Graphs with Applications",
      "abstract": ". In this paper, we establish a novel balanced separator theorem
      for Unit Disk Graphs (UDGs) , which mimics the well-known Lipton and Tarjan\u2019s
      planar balanced shortest paths separator theorem. We prove that, in any n -vertex
      UDG G , one can \ufb01nd two hop-shortest paths P ( s, x ) and P ( s, y ) such
      that the removal of the 3-hop-neighborhood of these paths (i.e., N 3 G [ P (
      s, x ) \u222a P ( s, y )]) from G leaves no connected component with more than
      2 / 3 n vertices. This new balanced shortest-paths\u20143-hop-neighborhood separator
      theorem allows us to build, for any n -vertex UDG G , a system T ( G ) of at
      most 2 log 3 2 n + 2 spanning trees of G such that, for any two vertices x and
      y of G , there exists a tree T in T ( G ) with d T ( x, y ) \u2264 3 \u00b7
      d G ( x, y ) + 12. That is, the distances in any UDG can be approximately represented
      by the distances in at most 2 log 32 n + 2 of its spanning trees. Using these
      results, we propose a new compact and low delay routing labeling scheme for
      UDGs. They often model wireless ad hoc networks. We show that one can assign
      each vertex of an n -vertex UDG G a compact O (log 2 n )-bit label such that,
      given the label of a source vertex and the label of a destination, it is possible
      to compute e\ufb03ciently, based solely on these two labels, a neighbor of the
      source vertex that heads in the direction of the destination. We prove that
      this routing labeling scheme has a constant hop route-stretch (= hop delay ),
      i.e., for each two vertices x and y of G , it produces a routing path with h
      ( x, y ) hops (edges) such that h ( x, y ) \u2264 3 \u00b7 d G ( x, y ) + 12,
      where d G ( x, y ) is the hop distance between x and y in G . To the best of
      our knowledge, this is the \ufb01rst compact routing scheme for UDGs which not
      only guaranties delivery but has a low hop delay. It is easy to see that, for
      UDGs, a constant hop route-stretch implies a constant length route-stretch and
      a constant power route-stretch .", "venue": "", "year": 2008, "referenceCount":

      "title": "On Solving Reachability in Grid Digraphs using a Pseudoseparator",
      "abstract": ". The reachability problem asks to decide if there exists a path
      from one vertex to another in a digraph. In a grid digraph, the vertices are
      the points of a two-dimensional square grid, and an edge can occur between a
      vertex and its immediate horizontal and vertical neighbors only. Asano and Doerr
      (CCCG\u201911) presented the \ufb01rst simultaneous time-space bound for reachability
      in grid digraphs by solving the problem in polynomial time and \ud835\udc42
      ( \ud835\udc5b 1 / 2 + \ud835\udf16 ) space. In 2018, the space complexity was
      improved to \u02dc \ud835\udc42 ( \ud835\udc5b 1 / 3 ) by Ashida and Nakagawa
      (SoCG\u201918). In this paper, we show that there exists a polynomial-time algorithm
      that uses \ud835\udc42 ( \ud835\udc5b 1 / 4 + \ud835\udf16 ) space to solve
      the reachability problem in a grid digraph containing \ud835\udc5b vertices.
      We de\ufb01ne and construct a new separator-like device called pseudoseparator

      the question of whether it is FPT parameterized by the directed feedback vertex
      set (DFVS) number has become a longstanding open problem. In particular, the
      DFVS number is the largest natural directed width measure studied in the literature.
      In this paper, we provide a negative answer to the question, showing that even
      for the DFVS number, the problem remains W[1]-hard. As a consequence, we also
      obtain that Longest Cycle is W[1]-hard on directed graphs when parameterized

      oracles, there are still large gaps between the best constructions for spanners

      stretch of $1+\\varepsilon$ plus some additive stretch. A fundamental open problem
      is whether such a bound is achievable for distance oracles as well. Specifically,

      This question remains a crucial area of investigation, and finding a positive

      Problems", "abstract": "A matching $M$ in a graph $G$ is an \\emph{acyclic matching}
      if the subgraph of $G$ induced by the endpoints of the edges of $M$ is a forest.
      Given a graph $G$ and a positive integer $\\ell$, Acyclic Matching asks whether
      $G$ has an acyclic matching of size (i.e., the number of edges) at least $\\ell$.
      In this paper, we first prove that assuming $\\mathsf{W[1]\\nsubseteq FPT}$,
      there does not exist any $\\mathsf{FPT}$-approximation algorithm for Acyclic
      Matching that approximates it within a constant factor when the parameter is
      the size of the matching. Our reduction is general in the sense that it also
      asserts $\\mathsf{FPT}$-inapproximability for Induced Matching and Uniquely
      Restricted Matching as well. We also consider three below-guarantee parameters
      for Acyclic Matching, viz. $\\frac{n}{2}-\\ell$, $\\mathsf{MM(G)}-\\ell$, and
      $\\mathsf{IS(G)}-\\ell$, where $n$ is the number of vertices in $G$, $\\mathsf{MM(G)}$
      is the matching number of $G$, and $\\mathsf{IS(G)}$ is the independence number
      of $G$. Furthermore, we show that Acyclic Matching does not exhibit a polynomial
      kernel with respect to vertex cover number (or vertex deletion distance to clique)
      plus the size of the matching unless $\\mathsf{NP}\\subseteq\\mathsf{coNP}\\slash\\mathsf{poly}$.",

      Oracles, Tree Covers, and More", "abstract": "The notion of shortcut partition,
      introduced recently by Chang, Conroy, Le, Milenkovi\\''c, Solomon, and Than
      [CCLMST23], is a new type of graph partition into low-diameter clusters. Roughly
      speaking, the shortcut partition guarantees that for every two vertices $u$
      and $v$ in the graph, there exists a path between $u$ and $v$ that intersects
      only a few clusters. They proved that any planar graph admits a shortcut partition
      and gave several applications, including a construction of tree cover for arbitrary
      planar graphs with stretch $1+\\varepsilon$ and $O(1)$ many trees for any fixed
      $\\varepsilon \\in (0,1)$. However, the construction heavily exploits planarity
      in multiple steps, and is thus inherently limited to planar graphs. In this
      work, we breach the\"planarity barrier\"to construct a shortcut partition for
      $K_r$-minor-free graphs for any $r$. To this end, we take a completely different
      approach -- our key contribution is a novel deterministic variant of the cop
      decomposition in minor-free graphs [And86, AGG14]. Our shortcut partition for
      $K_r$-minor-free graphs yields several direct applications. Most notably, we
      construct the first optimal distance oracle for $K_r$-minor-free graphs, with
      $1+\\varepsilon$ stretch, linear space, and constant query time for any fixed
      $\\varepsilon \\in (0,1)$. The previous best distance oracle [AG06] uses $O(n\\log
      n)$ space and $O(\\log n)$ query time, and its construction relies on Robertson-Seymour
      structural theorem and other sophisticated tools. We also obtain the first tree
      cover of $O(1)$ size for minor-free graphs with stretch $1+\\varepsilon$, while
      the previous best $(1+\\varepsilon)$-tree cover has size $O(\\log^2 n)$ [BFN19].",

      "A 2-packing set for an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ is a subset $\\mathcal{S}

      neighbors. Finding a 2-packing set of maximum cardinality is a NP-hard problem.
      We develop a new approach to solve this problem on arbitrary graphs using its
      close relation to the independent set problem. Thereby, our algorithm red2pack
      uses new data reduction rules specific to the 2-packing set problem as well
      as a graph transformation. Our experiments show that we outperform the state-of-the-art
      for arbitrary graphs with respect to solution quality and also are able to compute
      solutions multiple orders of magnitude faster than previously possible. For
      example, we are able to solve 63% of our graphs to optimality in less than a
      second while the competitor for arbitrary graphs can only solve 5% of the graphs
      in the data set to optimality even with a 10 hour time limit. Moreover, our

      Acyclic Graphs", "abstract": "Graphs and graph unions. We mostly follow the
      graph theory terminology of Andersson et al. [1997]. A graph is undirected if
      all its edges are undirected, directed if all its edges are directed, and partially
      directed if it contains both directed and undirected edges. A directed graph
      that has no directed cycle is called a directed acyclic graph (DAG). A generalization
      of this idea is that of chain graphs: a partially directed graph is called a
      chain graph if it has no cycle which contains (i) at least one directed edge,
      and (ii) in which all directed edges are directed in the same direction as one
      moves along the cycle. We denote the neighbors of a vertex v in a graph G as
      NG(v), and an induced subgraph of G on a set X \u2286 V is denoted as G[X].
      The graph union (which we just call \u201cunion\u201d) G1 \u222aG2 includes
      vertices and edges present in any one of G1 or G2, i.e., VG1\u222aG2 = VG1 \u222aVG2
      , and EG1\u222aG2 = EG1 \u222aEG2 . The skeleton of a partially directed graph
      G is an undirected version of G which we get by ignoring the direction of all
      the edges: in particular, note that the skeleton of a partially directed graph
      is also the graph union of all the partially directed graphs with the same skeleton
      as G. A v-structure (or unshielded collider) in a partially directed graph G
      is an ordered triple of vertices (a, b, c) of G which induce the subgraph a\u2192

      "abstract": "The widespread use of graph data in various applications and the
      highly dynamic nature of today''s networks have made it imperative to analyze
      structural trends in dynamic graphs on a continual basis. The shortest path
      is a fundamental concept in graph analysis and recent research shows that counting

      maintaining the index in response to changes in the graph structure and develop
      incremental (IncSPC) and decremental (DecSPC) update algorithms for inserting
      and deleting vertices/edges, respectively. The main idea of these two algorithms
      is that we only locate the affected vertices to update the index. Our experiments

      "title": "Comparing Width Parameters on Graph Classes", "abstract": "We study
      how the relationship between non-equivalent width parameters changes once we
      restrict to some special graph class. As width parameters, we consider treewidth,
      clique-width, twin-width, mim-width, sim-width and tree-independence number,
      whereas as graph classes we consider $K_{t,t}$-subgraph-free graphs, line graphs
      and their common superclass, for $t \\geq 3$, of $K_{t,t}$-free graphs. We first
      provide a complete comparison when restricted to $K_{t,t}$-subgraph-free graphs,
      showing in particular that treewidth, clique-width, mim-width, sim-width and
      tree-independence number are all equivalent. This extends a result of Gurski
      and Wanke (2000) stating that treewidth and clique-width are equivalent for
      the class of $K_{t,t}$-subgraph-free graphs. Next, we provide a complete comparison
      when restricted to line graphs, showing in particular that, on any class of
      line graphs, clique-width, mim-width, sim-width and tree-independence number
      are all equivalent, and bounded if and only if the class of root graphs has
      bounded treewidth. This extends a resut of Gurski and Wanke (2007) stating that
      a class of graphs~${\\cal G}$ has bounded treewidth if and only if the class
      of line graphs of graphs in ${\\cal G}$ has bounded clique-width. We then provide
      an almost-complete comparison for $K_{t,t}$-free graphs, leaving one missing
      case. Our main result is that $K_{t,t}$-free graphs of bounded mim-width have
      bounded tree-independence number. This result has structural and algorithmic
      consequences. In particular, it proves a special case of a conjecture of Dallard,
      Milani\\v{c} and \\v{S}torgel. Finally, we consider the question of whether
      boundedness of a certain width parameter is preserved under graph powers. We
      show that the question has a positive answer for sim-width precisely in the
      case of odd powers.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

      "abstract": "A matching is an independent set of edges in a graph G; an induced
      matching is a matching with an additional property that no two of its edges
      are joined by an edge in G. An induced matching M in a graph G is maximal if
      no other induced matching in G contains M. In the proposed game, players alternate
      choose edges on a graph while maintaining an induced matching. They continue
      until the matching is maximal (i.e. no player can choose another edge), and
      the last player to choose an edge wins. This paper will discuss patterns for
      this game and prove results on several categories of graphs including Complete
      Graphs, Path Graphs, Cycle Graphs, and Ladder Graphs. In addition, a novel Line-Adjacency

      Bimodality is at the heart of many types of graph layouts, such as upward drawings,

      a spanning subgraph $H$ on $O(n)$ edges. This can be achieved in linear $O(m
      + n)$ time via breadth-first search. But can we hope for \\emph{sublinear} runtime
      in some range of parameters? If the goal is to return $H$ as an adjacency list,
      there are simple lower bounds showing that $\\Omega(m + n)$ runtime is necessary.
      If the goal is to return $H$ as an adjacency matrix, then we need $\\Omega(n^2)$
      time just to write down the entries of the output matrix. However, we show that
      neither of these lower bounds still apply if instead the goal is to return $H$
      as an \\emph{implicit} adjacency matrix, which we call an \\emph{adjacency oracle}.
      An adjacency oracle is a data structure that gives a user the illusion that
      an adjacency matrix has been computed: it accepts edge queries $(u, v)$, and
      it returns in near-constant time a bit indicating whether $(u, v) \\in E(H)$.
      Our main result is that one can construct an adjacency oracle for a spanning
      subgraph on at most $(1+\\varepsilon)n$ edges, in $\\tilde{O}(n \\varepsilon^{-1})$
      time, and that this construction time is near-optimal. Additional results include
      constructions of adjacency oracles for $k$-connectivity certificates and spanners,
      which are similarly sublinear on dense-enough input graphs. Our adjacency oracles
      are closely related to Local Computation Algorithms (LCAs) for graph sparsifiers;
      they can be viewed as LCAs with some computation moved to a preprocessing step,
      in order to speed up queries. Our oracles imply the first Local algorithm for
      computing sparse spanning subgraphs of general input graphs in $\\tilde{O}(n)$
      query time, which works by constructing our adjacency oracle, querying it once,
      and then throwing the rest of the oracle away. This addresses an open problem

      represent similarity, and the task is to partition the vertices into two equally
      sized clusters, while minimizing the number of pairs of similar objects that
      end up in different clusters. In this paper, we initiate the study of a fair
      version of Minimum Bisection. In this problem, the vertices of the graph are

      "title": "Tight Approximations for Graphical House Allocation", "abstract":
      "The Graphical House Allocation (GHA) problem asks: how can $n$ houses (each
      with a fixed non-negative value) be assigned to the vertices of an undirected
      graph $G$, so as to minimize the sum of absolute differences along the edges
      of $G$? This problem generalizes the classical Minimum Linear Arrangement problem,
      as well as the well-known House Allocation Problem from Economics. Recent work
      has studied the computational aspects of GHA and observed that the problem is
      NP-hard and inapproximable even on particularly simple classes of graphs, such
      as vertex disjoint unions of paths. However, the dependence of any approximations
      on the structural properties of the underlying graph had not been studied. In
      this work, we give a nearly complete characterization of the approximability
      of GHA. We present algorithms to approximate the optimal envy on general graphs,
      trees, planar graphs, bounded-degree graphs, and bounded-degree planar graphs.
      For each of these graph classes, we then prove matching lower bounds, showing
      that in each case, no significant improvement can be attained unless P = NP.
      We also present general approximation ratios as a function of structural parameters
      of the underlying graph, such as treewidth; these match the tight upper bounds
      in general, and are significantly better approximations for many natural subclasses
      of graphs. Finally, we investigate the special case of bounded-degree trees
      in some detail. We first refute a conjecture by Hosseini et al. [2023] about
      the structural properties of exact optimal allocations on binary trees by means
      of a counterexample on a depth-$3$ complete binary tree. This refutation, together
      with our hardness results on trees, might suggest that approximating the optimal
      envy even on complete binary trees is infeasible. Nevertheless, we present a
      linear-time algorithm that attains a $3$-approximation on complete binary trees.",

      "title": "Labeling Methods for Partially Ordered Paths", "abstract": "The landscape
      of applications and subroutines relying on shortest path computations continues
      to grow steadily. This growth is driven by the undeniable success of shortest
      path algorithms in theory and practice. It also introduces new challenges as
      the models and assessing the optimality of paths become more complicated. Hence,
      multiple recent publications in the field adapt existing labeling methods in
      an ad-hoc fashion to their specific problem variant without considering the
      underlying general structure: they always deal with multi-criteria scenarios
      and those criteria define different partial orders on the paths. In this paper,
      we introduce the partial order shortest path problem (POSP), a generalization
      of the multi-objective shortest path problem (MOSP) and in turn also of the
      classical shortest path problem. POSP captures the particular structure of many
      shortest path applications as special cases. In this generality, we study optimality
      conditions or the lack of them, depending on the objective functions'' properties.
      Our final contribution is a big lookup table summarizing our findings and providing
      the reader an easy way to choose among the most recent multicriteria shortest
      path algorithms depending on their problem''s weight structure. Examples range
      from time-dependent shortest path and bottleneck path problems to the fuzzy
      shortest path problem and complex financial weight functions studied in the
      public transportation community. Our results hold for general digraphs and therefore
      surpass previous generalizations that were limited to acyclic graphs.", "venue":

      Edges (SEFE) asks whether there exists a planar drawing for each input graph

      the vertex cover number, and the number of cutvertices are intractable. We also
      settle the tractability of all pairs of these parameters. We give FPT algorithms

      "abstract": "A graph G is a k-leaf power, for an integer k>= 2, if there is
      a tree T with leaf set V(G) such that, for all vertices x, y in V(G), the edge
      xy exists in G if and only if the distance between x and y in T is at most k.
      Such a tree T is called a k-leaf root of G. The computational problem of constructing
      a k-leaf root for a given graph G and an integer k, if any, is motivated by
      the challenge from computational biology to reconstruct phylogenetic trees.
      For fixed k, Lafond [SODA 2022] recently solved this problem in polynomial time.
      In this paper, we propose to study optimal leaf roots of graphs G, that is,
      the k-leaf roots of G with minimum k value. Thus, all k''-leaf roots of G satisfy
      k<= k''. In terms of computational biology, seeking optimal leaf roots is more
      justified as they yield more probable phylogenetic trees. Lafond''s result does
      not imply polynomial-time computability of optimal leaf roots, because, even
      for optimal k-leaf roots, k may (exponentially) depend on the size of G. This
      paper presents a linear-time construction of optimal leaf roots for chordal
      cographs (also known as trivially perfect graphs). Additionally, it highlights
      the importance of the parity of the parameter k and provides a deeper insight

      "Graphs are fundamental objects that find widespread applications across computer
      science and beyond. Graph Theory has yielded deep insights about structural
      properties of various families of graphs, which are leveraged in the design
      and analysis of algorithms for graph optimization problems and other computational
      optimization problems. These insights have also proved helpful in understanding
      the limits of efficient computation by providing constructions of hard problem
      instances. At the same time, algorithmic tools and techniques provide a fresh
      perspective on graph theoretic problems, often leading to novel discoveries.
      In this thesis, we exploit this symbiotic relationship between graph theory
      and algorithms for graph optimization problems and beyond. This thesis consists
      of three parts. In the first part, we study a graph routing problem called the
      Node-Disjoint Paths (NDP) problem. Given a graph and a set of source-destination
      pairs of its vertices, the goal is to route the maximum number of pairs via
      node-disjoint paths. We come close to resolving the approximability of NDP by
      showing that it is $n^{\\Omega(1/poly\\log\\log n)}$-hard to approximate, even
      on grid graphs, where n is the number of vertices. In the second part of this
      thesis, we use graph decomposition techniques developed for efficient algorithms
      to derive a graph theoretic result. We show that for every n-vertex expander
      graph G, if H is any graph with at most $O(n/\\log n)$ vertices and edges, then
      H is a minor of G. In the last part, we show that the graph theoretic tools
      and graph algorithmic techniques can shed light on problems seemingly unrelated
      to graphs. We show that the randomized space complexity of the Longest Increasing
      Subsequence (LIS) problem in the streaming model is intrinsically tied to the
      query-complexity of the Non-Crossing Matching problem on graphs in a new model
      of computation that we define.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

      multiple recent publications in the field adapt existing labeling methods in
      an ad-hoc fashion to their specific problem variant without considering the
      underlying general structure: they always deal with multi-criteria scenarios
      and those criteria define different partial orders on the paths. In this paper,
      we introduce the partial order shortest path problem (POSP), a generalization
      of the multi-objective shortest path problem (MOSP) and in turn also of the
      classical shortest path problem. POSP captures the particular structure of many
      shortest path applications as special cases. In this generality, we study optimality

      Our final contribution is a big lookup table summarizing our findings and providing

      Problem in Regular Grid Maps", "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel algorithm
      for solving the point-to-point shortest path problem in a static regular 8-neighbor
      connectivity (G8) grid. This algorithm can be seen as a generalization of Hadlock
      algorithm to G8 grids, and is shown to be theoretically equivalent to the relaxed
      $A^*$ ($RA^*$) algorithm in terms of the provided solution''s path length, but
      with substantial time and memory savings, due to a completely different computation
      strategy, based on defining a set of lookup matrices. Through an experimental
      study on grid maps of various types and sizes (1290 runs on 43 maps), it is
      proven to be 2.25 times faster than $RA^*$ and 17 times faster than the original
      $A^*$, in average. Moreover, it is more memory-efficient, since it does not
      need to store a G score matrix.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":
