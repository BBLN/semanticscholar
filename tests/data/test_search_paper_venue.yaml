        A Large-Scale Generative Language Model", "abstract": "Pretrained general-purpose
        language models can achieve state-of-the-art accuracies in various natural
        language processing domains by adapting to downstream tasks via zero-shot,
        few-shot and \ufb01ne-tuning techniques. Because of their success, the size
        of these models has increased rapidly, requiring high-performance hardware,
        software, and algorithmic techniques to enable training such large models.
        As the result of a joint effort between Microsoft and NVIDIA, we present details
        on the training of the largest monolithic transformer based language model,
        Megatron-Turing NLG 530B (MT-NLG), with 530 billion parameters. In this paper,
        we \ufb01rst focus on the infrastructure as well as the 3D parallelism methodology
        used to train this model using DeepSpeed and Megatron. Next, we detail the
        training process, the design of our training corpus, and our data curation
        techniques, which we believe is a key ingredient to the success of the model.
        Finally, we discuss various evaluation results, as well as other interesting
        observations and new properties exhibited by MT-NLG. We demonstrate that MT-NLG
        achieves superior zero-, one-, and few-shot learning accuracies on several
        NLP benchmarks and establishes new state-of-the-art results. We believe that
        our contributions will help further the development of large-scale training
        infrastructures, large-scale language models, and natural language generations.",

        physical system can be perfectly simulated by a universal model computing
        machine operating by finite means\u2019. Classical physics and the universal
        Turing machine, because the former is continuous and the latter discrete,
        do not obey the principle, at least in the strong form above. A class of model
        computing machines that is the quantum generalization of the class of Turing
        machines is described, and it is shown that quantum theory and the ''universal

        resembling the universal quantum computer could, in principle, be built and

        "abstract": "Turing structures at the nanoscale Turing structures arise when
        imbalances in diffusion rates make a stable steady-state system sensitive
        to small heterogeneous perturbations. For example, Turing patterns occur in
        chemical reactions when a fast-moving inhibitor controls the motion of a slower-moving
        activator. Tan et al. grew polyamide membranes by using interfacial polymerization,
        where the reactions occur at the interface between oil and water layers. The
        addition of polyvinyl alcohol to the aqueous phase reduced the diffusion of
        the monomer. This process generates membranes with more bumps, voids, and
        islands, which prove to be better for water desalination. Science, this issue
        p. 518 Turing structures generated via diffusion-driven instabilities make
        polyamide membranes for water desalination. The emergence of Turing structures
        is of fundamental importance, and designing these structures and developing
        their applications have practical effects in chemistry and biology. We use
        a facile route based on interfacial polymerization to generate Turing-type
        polyamide membranes for water purification. Manipulation of shapes by control
        of reaction conditions enabled the creation of membranes with bubble or tube
        structures. These membranes exhibit excellent water-salt separation performance
        that surpasses the upper-bound line of traditional desalination membranes.
        Furthermore, we show the existence of high water permeability sites in the
        Turing structures, where water transport through the membranes is enhanced.",

        "In 2019, the rapid rate at which GPU manufacturers refresh their designs,
        coupled with their reluctance to disclose microarchitectural details, is still
        a hurdle for those software designers who want to extract the highest possible
        performance. Last year, these very reasons motivated us to dissect the Volta
        GPU architecture using microbenchmarks. \nThe introduction in August 2018
        of Turing, NVidia''s latest architecture, pressed us to update our study.
        In this report, we examine Turing and compare it quantitatively against previous
        NVidia GPU generations. Specifically, we study the T4 GPU: a low-power board
        aiming at inference applications. We describe its improvements against its
        inference-oriented predecessor: the P4 GPU based on the Pascal architecture.
        Both T4 and P4 GPUs achieve significantly higher frequency-per-Watt figures
        than their full-size counterparts. \nWe study the performance of the T4''s
        TensorCores, finding a much higher throughput on low-precision operands than
        on the P4 GPU. We reveal that Turing introduces new instructions that express
        matrix math more succinctly. We map Turing''s instruction space, finding the
        same encoding as Volta, and additional instructions. We reveal that the Turing
        TU104 chip has the same memory hierarchy depth as the Volta GV100; cache levels
        sizes on the TU104 are frequently twice as large as those found on the Pascal
        GP104. We benchmark each constituent of the T4 memory hierarchy and find substantial
        overall performance improvements over its P4 predecessor. We studied how clock
        throttling affects compute-intensive workloads that hit power or thermal limits.
        \nMany of our findings are novel, published here for the first time. All of
        them can guide high-performance software developers get closer to the GPU''s
        peak performance.", "venue": "ArXiv", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 8, "citationCount":

        "title": "Stochastic Turing patterns in a synthetic bacterial population",
        "abstract": "Significance In 1952, Alan Turing proposed that biological morphogenesis
        could arise from a dynamical process in reaction systems with a rapidly diffusing
        inhibitor and a slowly diffusing activator. Turing\u2019s conditions are disappointingly
        hard to achieve in nature, but recent stochastic extension of the theory predicts
        pattern formation without such strong conditions. We have forward-engineered
        bacterial populations with signaling molecules that form a stochastic activator\u2013inhibitor
        system that does not satisfy the classic Turing conditions but exhibits disordered
        patterns with a defined length scale and spatial correlations that agree quantitatively
        with stochastic Turing theory. Our results suggest that Turing-type mechanisms,
        driven by gene expression or other source of stochasticity, may underlie a
        much broader range of patterns in nature than currently thought. The origin
        of biological morphology and form is one of the deepest problems in science,
        underlying our understanding of development and the functioning of living
        systems. In 1952, Alan Turing showed that chemical morphogenesis could arise
        from a linear instability of a spatially uniform state, giving rise to periodic
        pattern formation in reaction\u2013diffusion systems but only those with a
        rapidly diffusing inhibitor and a slowly diffusing activator. These conditions
        are disappointingly hard to achieve in nature, and the role of Turing instabilities
        in biological pattern formation has been called into question. Recently, the
        theory was extended to include noisy activator\u2013inhibitor birth and death
        processes. Surprisingly, this stochastic Turing theory predicts the existence
        of patterns over a wide range of parameters, in particular with no severe
        requirement on the ratio of activator\u2013inhibitor diffusion coefficients.
        To explore whether this mechanism is viable in practice, we have genetically
        engineered a synthetic bacterial population in which the signaling molecules
        form a stochastic activator\u2013inhibitor system. The synthetic pattern-forming
        gene circuit destabilizes an initially homogenous lawn of genetically engineered
        bacteria, producing disordered patterns with tunable features on a spatial
        scale much larger than that of a single cell. Spatial correlations of the
        experimental patterns agree quantitatively with the signature predicted by
        theory. These results show that Turing-type pattern-forming mechanisms, if
        driven by stochasticity, can potentially underlie a broad range of biological
        patterns. These findings provide the groundwork for a unified picture of biological
        morphogenesis, arising from a combination of stochastic gene expression and
        dynamical instabilities.", "venue": "Proceedings of the National Academy of

        studied, but less is known concerning symmetry-breaking instabilities in heterogeneous
        media. It is non-trivial to separate observed spatial patterning due to inherent
        spatial heterogeneity from emergent patterning due to nonlinear instability.
        We employ WKBJ asymptotics to investigate Turing instabilities for a spatially
        heterogeneous reaction\u2013diffusion system, and derive conditions for instability
        which are local versions of the classical Turing conditions. We find that
        the structure of unstable modes differs substantially from the typical trigonometric
        functions seen in the spatially homogeneous setting. Modes of different growth
        rates are localized to different spatial regions. This localization helps
        explain common amplitude modulations observed in simulations of Turing systems
        in heterogeneous settings. We numerically demonstrate this theory, giving
        an illustrative example of the emergent instabilities and the striking complexity
        arising from spatially heterogeneous reaction\u2013diffusion systems. Our
        results give insight both into systems driven by exogenous heterogeneity,
        as well as successive pattern forming processes, noting that most scenarios
        in biology do not involve symmetry breaking from homogeneity, but instead
        consist of sequential evolutions of heterogeneous states. The instability

        "title": "Visual Turing test for computer vision systems", "abstract": "Significance
        In computer vision, as in other fields of artificial intelligence, the methods
        of evaluation largely define the scientific effort. Most current evaluations
        measure detection accuracy, emphasizing the classification of regions according
        to objects from a predefined library. But detection is not the same as understanding.
        We present here a different evaluation system, in which a query engine prepares
        a written test (\u201cvisual Turing test\u201d) that uses binary questions
        to probe a system\u2019s ability to identify attributes and relationships
        in addition to recognizing objects. Today, computer vision systems are tested
        by their accuracy in detecting and localizing instances of objects. As an
        alternative, and motivated by the ability of humans to provide far richer
        descriptions and even tell a story about an image, we construct a \u201cvisual
        Turing test\u201d: an operator-assisted device that produces a stochastic
        sequence of binary questions from a given test image. The query engine proposes
        a question; the operator either provides the correct answer or rejects the
        question as ambiguous; the engine proposes the next question (\u201cjust-in-time
        truthing\u201d). The test is then administered to the computer-vision system,
        one question at a time. After the system\u2019s answer is recorded, the system
        is provided the correct answer and the next question. Parsing is trivial and
        deterministic; the system being tested requires no natural language processing.
        The query engine employs statistical constraints, learned from a training
        set, to produce questions with essentially unpredictable answers\u2014the
        answer to a question, given the history of questions and their correct answers,
        is nearly equally likely to be positive or negative. In this sense, the test
        is only about vision. The system is designed to produce streams of questions
        that follow natural story lines, from the instantiation of a unique object,
        through an exploration of its properties, and on to its relationships with
        other uniquely instantiated objects.", "venue": "Proceedings of the National

        development in sharks", "abstract": "Diverse skin appendages, from shark denticles
        to bird feathers, develop via a conserved and ancient Turing patterning mechanism.
        Vertebrates have a vast array of epithelial appendages, including scales,
        feathers, and hair. The developmental patterning of these diverse structures
        can be theoretically explained by Alan Turing\u2019s reaction-diffusion system.
        However, the role of this system in epithelial appendage patterning of early
        diverging lineages (compared to tetrapods), such as the cartilaginous fishes,
        is poorly understood. We investigate patterning of the unique tooth-like skin
        denticles of sharks, which closely relates to their hydrodynamic and protective
        functions. We demonstrate through simulation models that a Turing-like mechanism
        can explain shark denticle patterning and verify this system using gene expression
        analysis and gene pathway inhibition experiments. This mechanism bears remarkable
        similarity to avian feather patterning, suggesting deep homology of the system.
        We propose that a diverse range of vertebrate appendages, from shark denticles
        to avian feathers and mammalian hair, use this ancient and conserved system,
        with slight genetic modulation accounting for broad variations in patterning.",

        "abstract": "Chemical and mechanical pattern formation is fundamental during
        embryogenesis and tissue development. Yet, the underlying molecular and cellular
        mechanisms are still elusive in many cases. Most current theories assume that
        tissue development is driven by chemical processes: either as a sequence of
        chemical patterns each depending on the previous one, or by patterns spontaneously
        arising from specific chemical interactions (such as \u201cTuring-patterns\u201d).
        Within both theories, mechanical patterns are usually regarded as passive
        by-products of chemical pre-patters. However, several experiments question
        these theories, and an increasing number of studies shows that tissue mechanics
        can actively influence chemical patterns during development. In this study,
        we thus focus on the interplay between chemical and mechanical processes during
        tissue development. On one hand, based on recent experimental data, we develop
        new mechanochemical simulation models of evolving tissues, in which the full
        3D representation of the tissue appears to be critical for obtaining a realistic
        mechanochemical behaviour. The presented modelling approach is flexible and
        numerically studied using state of the art finite element methods. Thus, it

        "What can artificial intelligence teach us about the mind? If AI''s underlying
        concept is that thinking is a computational process, then how can computation
        illuminate thinking? It''s a timely question. AI is all the rage, and the
        buzziest AI buzz surrounds adaptive machine learning: computer systems that
        learn intelligent behavior from massive amounts of data. This is what powers
        a driverless car, for example. In this book, Hector Levesque shifts the conversation
        to \"good old fashioned artificial intelligence,\" which is based not on heaps
        of data but on understanding commonsense intelligence. This kind of artificial
        intelligence is equipped to handle situations that depart from previous patterns
        -- as we do in real life, when, for example, we encounter a washed-out bridge
        or when the barista informs us there''s no more soy milk. Levesque considers
        the role of language in learning. He argues that a computer program that passes
        the famous Turing Test could be a mindless zombie, and he proposes another
        way to test for intelligence -- the Winograd Schema Test, developed by Levesque
        and his colleagues. \"If our goal is to understand intelligent behavior, we
        had better understand the difference between making it and faking it,\" he
        observes. He identifies a possible mechanism behind common sense and the capacity
        to call on background knowledge: the ability to represent objects of thought
        symbolically. As AI migrates more and more into everyday life, we should worry
        if systems without common sense are making decisions where common sense is
        needed.", "venue": "", "year": 2017, "referenceCount": 110, "citationCount":

        It has been suggested that extracellular signaling molecules with different

        signaling components is largely unknown. We developed an automated mathematical
        analysis to derive a catalog of realistic Turing networks. This analysis reveals

        "title": "Reinforcement Learning Neural Turing Machines", "abstract": "The
        expressive power of a machine learning model is closely related to the number
        of sequential computational steps it can learn. For example, Deep Neural Networks
        have been more successful than shallow networks because they can perform a
        greater number of sequential computational steps (each highly parallel). The
        Neural Turing Machine (NTM) [8] is a model that can compactly express an even
        greater number of sequential computational steps, so it is even more powerful
        than a DNN. Its memory addressing operations are designed to be differentiable;
        thus the NTM can be trained with backpropagation. While differentiable memory
        is relatively easy to implement and train, it necessitates accessing the entire
        memory content at each computational step. This makes it difficult to implement
        a fast NTM. In this work, we use the Re inforce algorithm to learn where to
        access the memory, while using backpropagation to learn what to write to the
        memory. We call this model the RL-NTM. Reinforce allows our model to access
        a constant number of memory cells at each computational step, so its implementation
        can be faster. The RL-NTM is the first mo del that can, in principle, learn
        programs of unbounded running time. We successfully trained the RL-NTM to
        solve a number of algorithmic tasks that are simpler than the ones solvable
        by the fully differentiable NTM. As the RL-NTM is a fairly intricate model,
        we needed a method for verifying the correctness of our implementation. To
        do so, we developed a simple technique for numerically checking arbitrary
        implementations of models that use Reinforce, which may be of independent

        "The Neural Turing Machine (NTM) is more expressive than all previously considered
        models because of its external memory. It can be viewed as a broader effort
        to use abstract external Interfaces and to learn a parametric model that interacts
        with them. \nThe capabilities of a model can be extended by providing it with
        proper Interfaces that interact with the world. These external Interfaces
        include memory, a database, a search engine, or a piece of software such as
        a theorem verifier. Some of these Interfaces are provided by the developers
        of the model. However, many important existing Interfaces, such as databases
        and search engines, are discrete. \nWe examine feasibility of learning models
        to interact with discrete Interfaces. We investigate the following discrete
        Interfaces: a memory Tape, an input Tape, and an output Tape. We use a Reinforcement
        Learning algorithm to train a neural network that interacts with such Interfaces
        to solve simple algorithmic tasks. Our Interfaces are expressive enough to
        make our model Turing complete.", "venue": "", "year": 2015, "referenceCount":

        "title": "Turing Computability: Theory and Applications", "abstract": "Turing''s
        famous 1936 paper introduced a formal definition of a computing machine, a
        Turing machine. This model led to both the development of actual computers
        and to computability theory, the study of what machines can and cannot compute.
        This book presents classical computability theory from Turing and Post to
        current results and methods, and their use in studying the information content
        of algebraic structures, models, and their relation to Peano arithmetic. The
        author presents the subject as an art to be practiced, and an art in the aesthetic
        sense of inherent beauty which all mathematicians recognize in their subject.
        Part I gives a thorough development of the foundations of computability, from
        the definition of Turing machines up to finite injury priority arguments.
        Key topics include relative computability, and computably enumerable sets,
        those which can be effectively listed but not necessarily effectively decided,
        such as the theorems of Peano arithmetic. Part II includes the study of computably
        open and closed sets of reals and basis and nonbasis theorems for effectively
        closed sets. Part III covers minimal Turing degrees. Part IV is an introduction
        to games and their use in proving theorems. Finally, Part V offers a short
        history of computability theory. The author has honed the content over decades
        according to feedback from students, lecturers, and researchers around the
        world. Most chapters include exercises, and the material is carefully structured
        according to importance and difficulty. The book is suitable for advanced
        undergraduate and graduate students in computer science and mathematics and
        researchers engaged with computability and mathematical logic.", "venue":

        has been profound. We exploit an abiological experimental system of emulsion

        test Turing\u2019s theory. Our experiments verify Turing\u2019s thesis of
        the chemical basis of morphogenesis and reveal a pattern, not previously predicted
        by theory, which we explain by extending Turing\u2019s model to include heterogeneity.
        Quantitative experimental results obtained using this artificial cellular
        system establish the strengths and weaknesses of the Turing model, applicable
        to biology and materials science alike, and pinpoint which directions are
        required for improvement. Alan Turing, in \u201cThe Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis\u201d
        [Turing AM (1952) Philos Trans R Soc Lond 237(641):37\u201372], described
        how, in circular arrays of identical biological cells, diffusion can interact
        with chemical reactions to generate up to six periodic spatiotemporal chemical
        structures. Turing proposed that one of these structures, a stationary pattern
        with a chemically determined wavelength, is responsible for differentiation.
        We quantitatively test Turing\u2019s ideas in a cellular chemical system consisting
        of an emulsion of aqueous droplets containing the Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky
        oscillatory chemical reactants, dispersed in oil, and demonstrate that reaction-diffusion
        processes lead to chemical differentiation, which drives physical morphogenesis
        in chemical cells. We observe five of the six structures predicted by Turing.
        In 2D hexagonal arrays, a seventh structure emerges, incompatible with Turing\u2019s
        original model, which we explain by modifying the theory to include heterogeneity.",

        high-power THz radiation on-chip", "abstract": "In nonlinear microresonators
        driven by continuous-wave (cw) lasers, Turing patterns have been studied in
        the formalism of Lugiato-Lefever equation with emphasis on its high coherence
        and exceptional robustness against perturbations. Destabilization of Turing
        pattern and transition to spatio-temporal chaos, however, limits the available
        energy carried in the Turing rolls and prevents further harvest of their high
        coherence and robustness to noise. Here we report a novel scheme to circumvent
        such destabilization, by incorporating the effect of local mode hybridizations,
        and attain globally stable Turing pattern formation in chip-scale nonlinear
        oscillators, achieving a record high power conversion efficiency of 45% and
        an elevated peak-to-valley contrast of 100. The stationary Turing pattern
        is discretely tunable across 430 GHz on a THz carrier, with a fractional frequency
        sideband non-uniformity measured at 7.3x10^-14. We demonstrate the simultaneous
        microwave and optical coherence of the Turing rolls at different evolution
        stages through ultrafast optical correlation techniques. The free running
        Turing roll coherence, 9 kHz in 200 ms and 160 kHz in 20 minutes, is transferred
        onto a plasmonic photomixer for one of the highest power THz coherent generation
        at room-temperature, with 1.1% optical-to-THz power conversion. Its long-term
        stability can be further improved by more than two orders of magnitude, reaching
        an Allan deviation of 6x10^-10 at 100 s, with a simple computer-aided slow
        feedback control. The demonstrated on-chip coherent high-power Turing-THz

        "title": "Competitive Distribution Estimation: Why is Good-Turing Good", "abstract":
        "Estimating distributions over large alphabets is a fundamental machine-learning
        tenet. Yet no method is known to estimate all distributions well. For example,
        add-constant estimators are nearly min-max optimal but often perform poorly
        in practice, and practical estimators such as absolute discounting, Jelinek-Mercer,
        and Good-Turing are not known to be near optimal for essentially any distribution.
        \n \nWe describe the first universally near-optimal probability estimators.
        For every discrete distribution, they are provably nearly the best in the
        following two competitive ways. First they estimate every distribution nearly
        as well as the best estimator designed with prior knowledge of the distribution
        up to a permutation. Second, they estimate every distribution nearly as well
        as the best estimator designed with prior knowledge of the exact distribution,
        but as all natural estimators, restricted to assign the same probability to
        all symbols appearing the same number of times. \n \nSpecifically, for distributions
        over k symbols and n samples, we show that for both comparisons, a simple
        variant of Good-Turing estimator is always within KL divergence of (3 + on(1))/n1/3
        from the best estimator, and that a more involved estimator is within On(min(k/n,
        1/\u221an)). Conversely, we show that any estimator must have a KL divergence
        at least \u03a9n(min(k/n, 1/n2/3)) over the best estimator for the first comparison,
        and at least \u03a9n(min(k/n, 1/\u221an)) for the second.", "venue": "NIPS",

        method for identifying security weaknesses, by conducting friendly attacks.
        Simulated pentesting automates this process, through designing a model of
        the system at hand, and using model-based attack planning to generate the
        attacks. Classical planning variants of this idea are being used commercially
        by the pentesting industry since 2010. Such models can pinpoint potentially
        dangerous combinations of known vulnerabilities, but ignore the incomplete
        knowledge characteristic of hacking from the attacker''s point of view. Yet,
        ideally, the simulation should conduct its attacks the same way a real attacker
        would. Hence the ultimate goal is much more ambitious: to realistically simulate
        a human hacker. This is a grand vision indeed; e.g., the classical Turing
        Test can be viewed as a sub-problem. Taking a more practical perspective,
        the simulated pentesting model space spans a broad range of sequential decision
        making problems. Analyzing prior work in AI and other relevant areas, we derive

        "The formation of ordered structures, in particular Turing patterns, in complex
        spatially extended systems has been observed in many different contexts, spanning
        from natural sciences (chemistry, physics, and biology) to technology (mechanics
        and electronics). In this paper, it is shown that the use of memristors in
        a simple cell of a spatially-extended circuit architecture allows us to design
        systems able to generate Turing patterns. In addition, the memristor parameters
        play a key role in the selection of the type and characteristics of the emerging
        pattern, which is also influenced by the initial conditions. The problem of
        finding the regions of parameters where Turing patterns may emerge in the
        proposed cellular architecture is solved in an analytic way, and numerical
        results are shown to illustrate the system behavior with respect to its parameters.",

        on Turing (1952) \u2018The chemical basis of morphogenesis\u2019", "abstract":
        "Alan Turing was neither a biologist nor a chemist, and yet the paper he published
        in 1952, \u2018The chemical basis of morphogenesis\u2019, on the spontaneous
        formation of patterns in systems undergoing reaction and diffusion of their
        ingredients has had a substantial impact on both fields, as well as in other
        areas as disparate as geomorphology and criminology. Motivated by the question
        of how a spherical embryo becomes a decidedly non-spherical organism such
        as a human being, Turing devised a mathematical model that explained how random
        fluctuations can drive the emergence of pattern and structure from initial
        uniformity. The spontaneous appearance of pattern and form in a system far
        away from its equilibrium state occurs in many types of natural process, and
        in some artificial ones too. It is often driven by very general mechanisms,
        of which Turing''s model supplies one of the most versatile. For that reason,
        these patterns show striking similarities in systems that seem superficially
        to share nothing in common, such as the stripes of sand ripples and of pigmentation
        on a zebra skin. New examples of \u2018Turing patterns'' in biology and beyond
        are still being discovered today. This commentary was written to celebrate
        the 350th anniversary of the journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal

        marker ` (never written over) and extends to infinitely many cells to the
        right. This machine has a head that can move left or right one cell in each
        step, and in each step it reads the current symbol it is currently scanning
        and overwrites it before moving on. Initally, the tape contains the input
        string, which is finite, on cells numbered 1 onwards (cell 0 contains `).
        The rest of the tape has a special symbol called the blank symbol t. Machine,
        initially, starts in state s with its input cell scanning the leftmost cell.
        In each step it changes its state based on its current state and symbol under
        its head, and it overwrites this cell, and moves its head left/right before
        taking the next step. The Turing machine is assumed to have two special halting
        states \u2014 accept state t and reject state r. Like the 2-way DFA, the Turing
        machine may never halt, if it does not reach either of these two halting states.
        The formal definition is as follows. Definition 1. A deterministic, one-tape
        Turing machine is M = (Q,\u03a3,\u0393,`,t, \u03b4, s, t, r) where \u2022

        of symbols written and read from the tape; \u03a3 ( \u0393, \u2022 `\u2208
        \u0393 \\ \u03a3 is the left endmarker, \u2022 t \u2208 \u0393 \\ \u03a3 is
        the blank symbol, \u2022 s \u2208 states is the start state, \u2022 t \u2208
        Q is the unique accepting state, \u2022 r \u2208 Q (r 6= t) is the unique
        rejecting state, \u2022 \u03b4 : (Q \\ {t, r})\u00d7\u0393\u2192 Q\u00d7\u0393\u00d7{L,R}
        is the transition function that describes the next state, symbol to be written,

        it is assumed that no transitions are enabled from either t or r.", "venue":

        to progress towards more challenging and open tasks and refueled the hope

        nipple-like nanostructures reducing the light reflection. Here we provide
        an extensive analysis of corneae across insect groups. Using atomic force
        microscopy, we discover a striking diversity of corneal nanocoatings, omnipresent
        in arthropods. These fascinating bionanostructures replicate the complete
        set of the Turing patterns\u2014shapes resulting from the reaction\u2212diffusion
        modeling underlying many examples of patterning in biological and physicochemical
        systems. Our work, verging on the interface of nanotechnology and zoology,
        evolution and biophysics, and ecology and genetics, sheds light on the molecular
        origin and evolutionary diversification of a beautiful diversity of insect
        corneal nanostructures. It also describes, to our knowledge, the first-ever
        biological example of Turing nanopatterns. Nipple-like nanostructures covering
        the corneal surfaces of moths, butterflies, and Drosophila have been studied
        by electron and atomic force microscopy, and their antireflective properties
        have been described. In contrast, corneal nanostructures of the majority of
        other insect orders have either been unexamined or examined by methods that
        did not allow precise morphological characterization. Here we provide a comprehensive
        analysis of corneal surfaces in 23 insect orders, revealing a rich diversity
        of insect corneal nanocoatings. These nanocoatings are categorized into four
        major morphological patterns and various transitions between them, many, to
        our knowledge, never described before. Remarkably, this unexpectedly diverse
        range of the corneal nanostructures replicates the complete set of Turing
        patterns, thus likely being a result of processes similar to those modeled
        by Alan Turing in his famous reaction\u2212diffusion system. These findings

        "abstract": "Time delays have been commonly used in modeling biological systems
        and can significantly change the dynamics of these systems. Quite a few works
        have been focused on analyzing the effect of small delays on the pattern formation
        of biological systems. In this paper, we investigate the effect of any delay
        on the formation of Turing patterns of reaction-diffusion equations. First,
        for a delay system in a general form, we propose a technique calculating the
        critical value of the time delay, above which a Turing instability occurs.
        Then we apply the technique to a predator-prey model and study the pattern
        formation of the model due to the delay. For the model in question, we find
        that when the time delay is small it has a uniform steady state or irregular
        patterns, which are not of Turing type; however, in the presence of a large
        delay we find spiral patterns of Turing type. For such a model, we also find
        that the critical delay is a decreasing function of the ratio of carrying
        capacity to half saturation of the prey density.", "venue": "Physical review.

        Networks", "abstract": "We study the computational capabilities of a biologically
        inspired neural model where the synaptic weights, the connectivity pattern,
        and the number of neurons can evolve over time rather than stay static. Our
        study focuses on the mere concept of plasticity of the model so that the nature
        of the updates is assumed to be not constrained. In this context, we show
        that the so-called plastic recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are capable of
        the precise super-Turing computational power--as the static analog neural
        networks--irrespective of whether their synaptic weights are modeled by rational
        or real numbers, and moreover, irrespective of whether their patterns of plasticity
        are restricted to bi-valued updates or expressed by any other more general
        form of updating. Consequently, the incorporation of only bi-valued plastic
        capabilities in a basic model of RNNs suffices to break the Turing barrier
        and achieve the super-Turing level of computation. The consideration of more
        general mechanisms of architectural plasticity or of real synaptic weights
        does not further increase the capabilities of the networks. These results
        support the claim that the general mechanism of plasticity is crucially involved
        in the computational and dynamical capabilities of biological neural networks.
        They further show that the super-Turing level of computation reflects in a
        suitable way the capabilities of brain-like models of computation.", "venue":

        "abstract": "It is hard to bridge the gap between mathematical formulations
        and biological implementations of Turing patterns, yet this is necessary for
        both understanding and engineering these networks with synthetic biology approaches.
        Here, we model a reaction\u2013diffusion system with two morphogens in a monostable
        regime, inspired by components that we recently described in a synthetic biology
        study in mammalian cells.1 The model employs a single promoter to express
        both the activator and inhibitor genes and produces Turing patterns over large
        regions of parameter space, using biologically interpretable Hill function
        reactions. We applied a stability analysis and identified rules for choosing
        biologically tunable parameter relationships to increase the likelihood of
        successful patterning. We show how to control Turing pattern sizes and time
        evolution by manipulating the values for production and degradation relationships.
        More importantly, our analysis predicts that steep dose\u2013response functions
        arising from cooperativity are mandatory for Turing patterns. Greater steepness
        increases parameter space and even reduces the requirement for differential
        diffusion between activator and inhibitor. These results demonstrate some
        of the limitations of linear scenarios for reaction\u2013diffusion systems

        of a supercritical Hopf bifurcation for the local kinetics is proved. In the
        spatial case, initiation of morphological patterns induced by diffusion is
        shown to occur in a suitable region of the parameter space. The intriguing
        interplay between Hopf and Turing instability is also considered, by investigating
        the spatio-temporal behaviour of the system in the neighbourhood of the codimension-two
        Turing--Hopf bifurcation point. An ADI (Alternating Direction Implicit) scheme
        based on high-order finite differences in space is applied to obtain numerical
        approximations of Turing patterns at the steady state and for the simulation
        of the oscillating Turing\u2013Hopf dynamics.", "venue": "European journal

        Game - Updated Edition", "abstract": "Alan Turing died in 1954, but the themes
        of his life epitomize the turn of the millennium. A pure mathematician from
        a tradition that prided itself on its impracticality, Turing laid the foundations
        for modern computer science, writes Andrew Hodges: Alan had proved that there
        was no \"miraculous machine\" that could solve all mathematical problems,
        but in the process he had discovered something almost equally miraculous,
        the idea of a universal machine that could take over the work of any machine.
        During World War II, Turing was the intellectual star of Bletchley Park, the
        secret British cryptography unit. His work cracking the German''s Enigma machine
        code was, in many ways, the first triumph of computer science. And Turing
        died because his identity as a homosexual was incompatible with cold-war ideas
        of security, implemented with machines and remorseless logic: \"It was his
        own invention, and it killed the goose that laid the golden eggs.\" Andrew
        Hodges''s remarkable insight weaves Turing''s mathematical and computer work
        with his personal life to produce one of the best biographies of our time,
        and the basis of the Derek Jacobi movie Breaking the Code. Hodges has the
        mathematical knowledge to explain the intellectual significance of Turing''s
        work, while never losing sight of the human and social picture: In this sense
        his life belied his work, for it could not be contained by the discrete state
        machine. At every stage his life raised questions about the connection (or
        lack of it) between the mind and the body, thought and action, intelligence
        and operations, science and society, the individual and history. And Hodges
        admits what all biographers know, but few admit, about their subjects: \"his
        inner code remains unbroken.\" Alan Turing is still an enigma. --Mary Ellen

        system to describe species anomalous superdiffusion. The effects of the superdiffusive
        exponent on pattern formation and pattern selection are studied. Our linear
        stability analysis shows that the wave number of the Turing pattern increases
        with the superdiffusive exponent. A weakly nonlinear analysis yields a system
        of amplitude equations and the analysis of these amplitude equations predicts
        parameter regimes where hexagons, stripes, and their coexistence are expected.
        Numerical simulations of the activator-inhibitor model near the stability
        boundaries confirm our analytical results. Since diffusion rate manifests
        in both diffusion constant and diffusion exponent, we numerically explore
        their interactions on the emergence of Turing patterns. When the activator
        and inhibitor have different superdiffusive exponents, we find that the critical
        ratio of the diffusion rate of the inhibitor to the activator, required for
        the formation of the Turing pattern, increases monotonically with the superdiffusive
        exponent. We conclude that small ratio (than unity) of anomalous diffusion
        exponent between the inhibitor and activator is more likely to promote the
        emergence of the Turing pattern, relative to the normal diffusion.", "venue":

        Turing''s theoretical ideas to people producing actual machines was significant
        and appreciated by everybody involved in computing from the moment he published
        his 1936 paper \u2018On Computable Numbers\u2019. Careful historians are aware
        that this popular conception is deeply misleading. We know from previous work
        by Campbell-Kelly, Aspray, Akera, Olley, Priestley, Daylight, Mounier-Kuhn,
        Haigh, and others that several computing pioneers, including Aiken, Eckert,
        Mauchly, and Zuse, did not depend on (let alone were they aware of) Turing''s
        1936 universal-machine concept. Furthermore, it is not clear whether any substance
        in von Neumann''s celebrated 1945 \u2018First Draft Report on the EDVAC\u2019
        is influenced in any identifiable way by Turing''s work. This raises the questions:
        (i) When does Turing enter the field? (ii) Why did the Association for Computing
        Machinery (ACM) honor Turing by associating his name to ACM''s most prestigious
        award, the Turing Award? Previous authors have been rather vague about these
        questions, suggesting some date between 1950 and the early 1960s as the point
        at which Turing is retroactively integrated into the foundations of computing
        and associating him in some way with the movement to develop something that
        people call computer science. In this paper, based on detailed examination
        of hitherto overlooked primary sources, attempts are made to reconstruct networks
        of scholars and ideas prevalent in the 1950s, and to identify a specific group
        of actors interested in theorizing about computations in computers and attracted
        to the idea of language as a frame in which to understand computation. By
        going back to Turing''s 1936 paper and, more importantly, to re-cast versions
        of Turing''s work published during the 1950s (Rosenbloom, Kleene, Markov),
        I identify the factors that made this group of scholars particularly interested
        in Turing''s work and provided the original vector by which Turing became
        to be appreciated in retrospect as the father of computer science.", "venue":

        "During the centennial year of his birth Alan Turing 1912--1954 has been widely
        celebrated as having laid the foundations for Computer Science, Automated
        Decryption, Systems Biology and the Turing Test. In this paper we investigate
        Turing''s motivations and expectations for the development of Machine Intelligence,
        as expressed in his 1950 article in Mind. We show that many of the trends
        and developments within AI over the last 50 years were foreseen in this foundational
        paper. In particular, Turing not only describes the use of Computational Logic
        but also the necessity for the development of Machine Learning in order to
        achieve human-level AI within a 50 year time-frame. His description of the
        Child Machine a machine which learns like an infant dominates the closing
        section of the paper, in which he provides suggestions for how AI might be
        achieved. Turing discusses three alternative suggestions which can be characterised
        as: 1 AI by programming, 2 AI by ab initio machine learning and 3 AI using
        logic, probabilities, learning and background knowledge. He argues that there
        are inevitable limitations in the first two approaches and recommends the
        third as the most promising. We compare Turing''s three alternatives to developments
        within AI, and conclude with a discussion of some of the unresolved challenges

        cells yield large Turing spaces for ligand-receptor-based Turing models.",
        "abstract": "Turing mechanisms can yield a large variety of patterns from
        noisy, homogenous initial conditions and have been proposed as patterning
        mechanism for many developmental processes. However, the molecular components
        that give rise to Turing patterns have remained elusive, and the small size
        of the parameter space that permits Turing patterns to emerge makes it difficult
        to explain how Turing patterns could evolve. We have recently shown that Turing
        patterns can be obtained with a single ligand if the ligand-receptor interaction
        is taken into account. Here we show that the general properties of ligand-receptor
        systems result in very large Turing spaces. Thus, the restriction of receptors
        to single cells, negative feedbacks, regulatory interactions among different
        ligand-receptor systems, and the clustering of receptors on the cell surface
        all greatly enlarge the Turing space. We further show that the feedbacks that
        occur in the FGF10-SHH network that controls lung branching morphogenesis
        are sufficient to result in large Turing spaces. We conclude that the cellular
        restriction of receptors provides a mechanism to sufficiently increase the
        size of the Turing space to make the evolution of Turing patterns likely.
        Additional feedbacks may then have further enlarged the Turing space. Given
        their robustness and flexibility, we propose that receptor-ligand-based Turing
        mechanisms present a general mechanism for patterning in biology.", "venue":

        has been an early and rapid innovation of tetrapods. Sheth et al. (p. 1476)
        report that a dramatic reduction in distally expressed Hox genes, in the absence
        of a functional morphogen signaling pathway, results in extreme polydactyly
        in mice. Mutant digits exhibited patterns reminiscent of the endoskeleton
        of fins, suggesting that an ancestral patterning mechanism has been deeply
        conserved in evolution. Mouse genetics and computer modeling suggest that
        a reaction-diffusion mechanism defines digit pattern. The formation of repetitive
        structures (such as stripes) in nature is often consistent with a reaction-diffusion
        mechanism, or Turing model, of self-organizing systems. We used mouse genetics
        to analyze how digit patterning (an iterative digit/nondigit pattern) is generated.
        We showed that the progressive reduction in Hoxa13 and Hoxd11-Hoxd13 genes
        (hereafter referred to as distal Hox genes) from the Gli3-null background
        results in progressively more severe polydactyly, displaying thinner and densely
        packed digits. Combined with computer modeling, our results argue for a Turing-type
        mechanism underlying digit patterning, in which the dose of distal Hox genes
        modulates the digit period or wavelength. The phenotypic similarity with fish-fin
        endoskeleton patterns suggests that the pentadactyl state has been achieved

        diffusion.", "abstract": "In this work we investigate the effect of density-dependent
        nonlinear diffusion on pattern formation in the Brusselator system. Through
        linear stability analysis of the basic solution we determine the Turing and
        the oscillatory instability boundaries. A comparison with the classical linear
        diffusion shows how nonlinear diffusion favors the occurrence of Turing pattern
        formation. We study the process of pattern formation both in one-dimensional
        and two-dimensional spatial domains. Through a weakly nonlinear multiple scales
        analysis we derive the equations for the amplitude of the stationary patterns.
        The analysis of the amplitude equations shows the occurrence of a number of
        different phenomena, including stable supercritical and subcritical Turing
        patterns with multiple branches of stable solutions leading to hysteresis.
        Moreover, we consider traveling patterning waves: When the domain size is
        large, the pattern forms sequentially and traveling wave fronts are the precursors
        to patterning. We derive the Ginzburg-Landau equation and describe the traveling
        front enveloping a pattern which invades the domain. We show the emergence
        of radially symmetric target patterns, and, through a matching procedure,
        we construct the outer amplitude equation and the inner core solution.", "venue":

        Turing mechanism", "abstract": "The main signalling proteins that control
        early kidney branching have been defined. Yet the underlying mechanism is
        still elusive. We have previously shown that a Schnakenberg-type Turing mechanism
        can recapitulate the branching and protein expression patterns in wild-type
        and mutant lungs, but it is unclear whether this mechanism would extend to
        other branched organs that are regulated by other proteins. Here, we show
        that the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor\u2013RET regulatory interaction
        gives rise to a Schnakenberg-type Turing model that reproduces the observed
        budding of the ureteric bud from the Wolffian duct, its invasion into the
        mesenchyme and the observed branching pattern. The model also recapitulates
        all relevant protein expression patterns in wild-type and mutant mice. The
        lung and kidney models are both based on a particular receptor\u2013ligand
        interaction and require (1) cooperative binding of ligand and receptor, (2)
        a lower diffusion coefficient for the receptor than for the ligand and (3)
        an increase in the receptor concentration in response to receptor\u2013ligand
        binding (by enhanced transcription, more recycling or similar). These conditions
        are met also by other receptor\u2013ligand systems. We propose that ligand\u2013receptor-based
        Turing patterns represent a general mechanism to control branching morphogenesis

        "title": "The Ghost in the Quantum Turing Machine", "abstract": "In honor
        of Alan Turing''s hundredth birthday, I unwisely set out some thoughts about
        one of Turing''s obsessions throughout his life, the question of physics and
        free will. I focus relatively narrowly on a notion that I call \"Knightian
        freedom\": a certain kind of in-principle physical unpredictability that goes
        beyond probabilistic unpredictability. Other, more metaphysical aspects of
        free will I regard as possibly outside the scope of science. I examine a viewpoint,
        suggested independently by Carl Hoefer, Cristi Stoica, and even Turing himself,
        that tries to find scope for \"freedom\" in the universe''s boundary conditions
        rather than in the dynamical laws. Taking this viewpoint seriously leads to
        many interesting conceptual problems. I investigate how far one can go toward
        solving those problems, and along the way, encounter (among other things)
        the No-Cloning Theorem, the measurement problem, decoherence, chaos, the arrow
        of time, the holographic principle, Newcomb''s paradox, Boltzmann brains,
        algorithmic information theory, and the Common Prior Assumption. I also compare
        the viewpoint explored here to the more radical speculations of Roger Penrose.
        The result of all this is an unusual perspective on time, quantum mechanics,
        and causation, of which I myself remain skeptical, but which has several appealing
        features. Among other things, it suggests interesting empirical questions
        in neuroscience, physics, and cosmology; and takes a millennia-old philosophical
        debate into some underexplored territory.", "venue": "The Once and Future

        is how the vast range of pattern and structure we observe in nature emerges
        from an almost uniformly homogeneous fertilized egg. In particular, the mechanisms
        by which biological systems maintain robustness, despite being subject to
        numerous sources of noise, are shrouded in mystery. Postulating plausible
        theoretical models of biological heterogeneity is not only difficult, but
        it is also further complicated by the problem of generating robustness, i.e.
        once we can generate a pattern, how do we ensure that this pattern is consistently
        reproducible in the face of perturbations to the domain, reaction time scale,
        boundary conditions and so forth. In this paper, not only do we review the
        basic properties of Turing''s theory, we highlight the successes and pitfalls
        of using it as a model for biological systems, and discuss emerging developments

        of Small Turing Machines", "abstract": "Drawing on various notions from theoretical
        computer science, we present a novel numerical approach, motivated by the
        notion of algorithmic probability, to the problem of approximating the Kolmogorov-Chaitin
        complexity of short strings. The method is an alternative to the traditional
        lossless compression algorithms, which it may complement, the two being serviceable
        for different string lengths. We provide a thorough analysis for all binary
        strings of length and for most strings of length by running all Turing machines
        with 5 states and 2 symbols ( with reduction techniques) using the most standard
        formalism of Turing machines, used in for example the Busy Beaver problem.
        We address the question of stability and error estimation, the sensitivity
        of the continued application of the method for wider coverage and better accuracy,
        and provide statistical evidence suggesting robustness. As with compression
        algorithms, this work promises to deliver a range of applications, and to
        provide insight into the question of complexity calculation of finite (and
        short) strings. Additional material can be found at the Algorithmic Nature
        Group website at http://www.algorithmicnature.org. An Online Algorithmic Complexity
        Calculator implementing this technique and making the data available to the

      techniques to enable training such large models. As the result of a joint effort
      between Microsoft and NVIDIA, we present details on the training of the largest
      monolithic transformer based language model, Megatron-Turing NLG 530B (MT-NLG),
      with 530 billion parameters. In this paper, we first focus on the infrastructure
      as well as the 3D parallelism methodology used to train this model using DeepSpeed
      and Megatron. Next, we detail the training process, the design of our training
      corpus, and our data curation techniques, which we believe is a key ingredient
      to the success of the model. Finally, we discuss various evaluation results,
      as well as other interesting observations and new properties exhibited by MT-NLG.
      We demonstrate that MT-NLG achieves superior zero-, one-, and few-shot learning
      accuracies on several NLP benchmarks and establishes new state-of-the-art results.
      We believe that our contributions will help further the development of large-scale
      training infrastructures, large-scale language models, and natural language
      generations.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 77, "citationCount":

      "title": "Arithmetic logical Irreversibility and the Turing''s Halt Problem",
      "abstract": "The Turing machine halting problem can be explained by several
      factors, including arithmetic logic irreversibility and memory erasure, which
      contribute to computational uncertainty due to information loss during computation.
      Essentially, this means that an algorithm can only preserve information about
      an input, rather than generate new information. This uncertainty arises from
      characteristics such as arithmetic logical irreversibility, Landauer''s principle,
      and memory erasure, which ultimately lead to a loss of information and an increase
      in entropy. To measure this uncertainty and loss of information, the concept
      of arithmetic logical entropy can be used. The Turing machine and its equivalent,
      general recursive functions can be understood through the {\\lambda} calculus
      and the Turing/Church thesis. However, there are certain recursive functions
      that cannot be fully understood or predicted by other algorithms due to the
      loss of information during logical-arithmetic operations. In other words, the
      behaviour of these functions cannot be completely determined at every stage
      of the computation due to a lack of information in their definition. While there
      are some cases where the behaviour of recursive functions is highly predictable,
      the lack of information in most cases makes it impossible for algorithms to
      determine if a program will halt or not. This inability to predict the outcome
      of the computation is the essence of the halting problem of the Turing machine.
      Even in cases where more information is available about the program, it is still
      difficult to determine with certainty if the program will halt or not. This
      also highlights the importance of the Turing oracle machine, which introduces
      information from outside the computation to compensate for the lack of information
      and ultimately decide the result of the computation.", "venue": "arXiv.org",

      properties of its global simulator is undecidable in the same sense as the Halting
      problem. Then, we show that computing the time, space, or error accumulated
      by the global simulator are simulation properties and therefore are undecidable.
      These simulation properties give rise to special relativistic e\ufb00ects in
      the relative model which we use to construct a relative Church-Turing-Deutsch

      artificial intelligence (XAI) is to improve the trust relationship in human-AI
      interaction. One assumption underlying research in transparent AI systems is
      that explanations help to better assess predictions of machine learning (ML)
      models, for instance by enabling humans to identify wrong predictions more efficiently.
      Recent empirical evidence however shows that explanations can have the opposite
      effect: When presenting explanations of ML predictions humans often tend to
      trust ML predictions even when these are wrong. Experimental evidence suggests
      that this effect can be attributed to how intuitive, or human, an AI or explanation
      appears. This effect challenges the very goal of XAI and implies that responsible
      usage of transparent AI methods has to consider the ability of humans to distinguish
      machine generated from human explanations. Here we propose a quantitative metric
      for XAI methods based on Turing''s imitation game, a Turing Test for Transparency.
      A human interrogator is asked to judge whether an explanation was generated
      by a human or by an XAI method. Explanations of XAI methods that can not be

      of Turing reaction model", "abstract": "Many cephalopods such as octopus and
      squid change their skin color purposefully within a very short time. Furthermore,
      it is widely known that some octopuses have the ability to change the color
      and unevenness of the skin and to mimic the surroundings in short time. However,
      much research has not been done on the entire mimicry mechanism in which the
      octopus recognizes the surrounding landscape and changes the skin pattern. It
      seems that there is no hypothetical model to explain the whole mimicry mechanism
      yet. In this study, the mechanism of octopus skin pattern formation was assumed
      to be based on the Turing model. Here, the pattern formation by the Turing model
      was realized by the equivalent filter calculation model using the cellular automaton,
      instead of directly solving the differential equations. It was shown that this
      model can create various patterns with two feature parameters. Furthermore,
      for the eyes recognition part where two features are extracted from the Turing
      pattern image, our study proposed a method that can be calculated back with
      small amount of calculation using the characteristics of the cellular Turing
      pattern model. These two calculations can be expressed in the same mathematical
      frame based on the cellular automaton model using the convolution filter. As
      a result, it can be created a model which is capable of extracting features
      from patterns and reconstructing patterns in a short time, the model is considered
      to be a basic model for considering the mimicry mechanism of octopus. Also,
      in terms of application to machine learning, it is considered that it shows
      the possibility of leading to a model with a small amount of learning calculation.",

      the potential of accelerate evaluation research on conversational AI. However,
      existing trainable dialogue evaluation models are generally restricted to classifiers
      trained in a purely supervised manner, which suffer a significant risk from
      adversarial attacking (e.g., a nonsensical response that enjoys a high classification
      score). To alleviate this risk, we propose an adversarial training approach
      to learn a robust model, ATT (Adversarial Turing Test), that discriminates machine-generated
      responses from human-written replies. In contrast to previous perturbation-based
      methods, our discriminator is trained by iteratively generating unrestricted
      and diverse adversarial examples using reinforcement learning. The key benefit
      of this unrestricted adversarial training approach is allowing the discriminator
      to improve robustness in an iterative attack-defense game. Our discriminator
      shows high accuracy on strong attackers including DialoGPT and GPT-3.", "venue":

      "title": "Polynomial Turing Kernels for Clique with an Optimal Number of Queries",
      "abstract": "A polynomial Turing kernel for some parameterized problem P is
      a polynomial-time algorithm that solves P using queries to an oracle of P whose
      sizes are upper-bounded by some polynomial in the parameter. Here the term \u201cpolynomial\u201d
      refers to the bound on the query sizes, as the running time of any kernel is
      required to be polynomial. One of the most important open goals in parameterized
      complexity is to understand the applicability and limitations of polynomial
      Turing Kernels. As any fixed-parameter tractable problem admits a Turing kernel
      of some size, the focus has mostly being on determining which problems admit
      such kernels whose query sizes can be indeed bounded by some polynomial. In
      this paper we take a different approach, and instead focus on the number of
      queries that a Turing kernel uses, assuming it is restricted to using only polynomial
      sized queries. Our study focuses on one the main problems studied in parameterized
      complexity, the Clique problem: Given a graph G and an integer k, determine
      whether there are k pairwise adjacent vertices in G. We show that Clique parameterized
      by several structural parameters exhibits the following phenomena: \u2022 It
      admits polynomial Turing kernels which use a sublinear number of queries, namely
      O(n/ log(n)) queries where n is the total size of the graph and c is any constant.
      This holds even for a very restrictive type of Turing kernels which we call
      OR-kernels. \u2022 It does not admit polynomial Turing kernels which use O(n)
      queries, unless NP \u2286 coNP / poly. For proving the second item above, we
      develop a new framework for bounding the number of queries needed by polynomial
      Turing kernels. This framework is inspired by the standard lower bounds framework
      for Karp kernels, and while it is quite similar, it still requires some novel
      ideas to allow its extension to the Turing setting.", "venue": "arXiv.org",

      "abstract": "It is well known that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) faced limitations
      in learning longterm dependencies that have been addressed by memory structures
      in long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. Matrix neural networks feature matrix
      representation which inherently preserves the spatial structure of data and
      has the potential to provide better memory structures when compared to canonical
      neural networks that use vector representation. Neural Turing machines (NTMs)
      are novel RNNs that implement notion of programmable computers with neural network
      controllers to feature algorithms that have copying, sorting, and associative
      recall tasks. In this paper, we study augmentation of memory capacity with matrix
      representation of RNNs and NTMs (MatNTMs). We investigate if matrix representation
      has a better memory capacity than the vector representations in conventional
      neural networks. We use a probabilistic model of the memory capacity using Fisher
      information and investigate how the memory capacity for matrix representation
      networks are limited under various constraints, and in general, without any
      constraints. In the case of memory capacity without any constraints, we found
      that the upper bound on memory capacity to be N for an N\u00d7N state matrix.

      "In 2019, the rapid rate at which GPU manufacturers refresh their designs, coupled
      with their reluctance to disclose microarchitectural details, is still a hurdle
      for those software designers who want to extract the highest possible performance.
      Last year, these very reasons motivated us to dissect the Volta GPU architecture
      using microbenchmarks. \nThe introduction in August 2018 of Turing, NVidia''s
      latest architecture, pressed us to update our study. In this report, we examine
      Turing and compare it quantitatively against previous NVidia GPU generations.
      Specifically, we study the T4 GPU: a low-power board aiming at inference applications.
      We describe its improvements against its inference-oriented predecessor: the
      P4 GPU based on the Pascal architecture. Both T4 and P4 GPUs achieve significantly
      higher frequency-per-Watt figures than their full-size counterparts. \nWe study
      the performance of the T4''s TensorCores, finding a much higher throughput on
      low-precision operands than on the P4 GPU. We reveal that Turing introduces
      new instructions that express matrix math more succinctly. We map Turing''s
      instruction space, finding the same encoding as Volta, and additional instructions.
      We reveal that the Turing TU104 chip has the same memory hierarchy depth as
      the Volta GV100; cache levels sizes on the TU104 are frequently twice as large
      as those found on the Pascal GP104. We benchmark each constituent of the T4
      memory hierarchy and find substantial overall performance improvements over
      its P4 predecessor. We studied how clock throttling affects compute-intensive
      workloads that hit power or thermal limits. \nMany of our findings are novel,
      published here for the first time. All of them can guide high-performance software
      developers get closer to the GPU''s peak performance.", "venue": "arXiv.org",

      "For a given distribution, learning algorithm, and performance metric, the rate
      of convergence (or data-scaling law) is the asymptotic behavior of the algorithm''s
      test performance as a function of number of train samples. Many learning methods
      in both theory and practice have power-law rates, i.e. performance scales as
      $n^{-\\alpha}$ for some $\\alpha>0$. Moreover, both theoreticians and practitioners
      are concerned with improving the rates of their learning algorithms under settings
      of interest. We observe the existence of a\"universal learner\", which achieves
      the best possible distribution-dependent asymptotic rate among all learning
      algorithms within a specified runtime (e.g. $O(n^2)$), while incurring only
      polylogarithmic slowdown over this runtime. This algorithm is uniform, and does
      not depend on the distribution, and yet achieves best-possible rates for all
      distributions. The construction itself is a simple extension of Levin''s universal
      search (Levin, 1973). And much like universal search, the universal learner
      is not at all practical, and is primarily of theoretical and philosophical interest.",

      we draw attention to the seemingly simpler challenge of determining whether
      one is interacting with a human or with a machine, in the context of everyday
      life. We are interested in re\ufb02ecting upon the importance of this Human-or-Machine
      question and the use one may make of a reliable answer thereto. Whereas Turing\u2019s
      original test is widely considered to be more of a thought experiment, the Human-or-Machine
      question as discussed here has obvious practical signi\ufb01cance. And while
      the jury is still not in regarding the possibility of machines that can mimic
      human behavior with high \ufb01delity in everyday contexts, we argue that near-term
      exploration of the issues raised here can contribute to development methods
      for computerized systems, and may also improve our understanding of human behavior

      by over 1.5 million users who engaged in anonymous two-minute chat sessions
      with either another human or an AI language model which was prompted to behave
      like humans. The task of the players was to correctly guess whether they spoke
      to a person or to an AI. This largest scale Turing-style test conducted to date
      revealed some interesting facts. For example, overall users guessed the identity
      of their partners correctly in only 68% of the games. In the subset of the games
      in which users faced an AI bot, users had even lower correct guess rates of
      60% (that is, not much higher than chance). This white paper details the development,

      (rather than just write or recall) programs that involve loops, including several

      Self-Attention (IRSA) in one (or a combination) of three ways: 1) Using strong
      repetitive structure in an example of an execution path of a target program

      3) Explicitly forbidding (skipping) self-attention to parts of the generated

      a connection between linguistic objects and classes in Large Language Model
      Machines (LLMMs) such as GPT3.5 and GPT4, and their counterparts in high level
      programming languages like Python. Our goal is to promote the development of
      Digital Nature: a worldview where digital and physical realities are seamlessly
      intertwined and can be easily manipulated by computational means. To achieve
      this, we exploit the inherent abstraction capabilities of LLMMs to build a bridge
      between human perception of the real world and the computational processes that
      mimic it. This approach enables ambiguous class definitions and interactions
      between objects to be realized in programming and ubiquitous computing scenarios.
      By doing so, we aim to facilitate seamless interaction between Turing Machine
      objects and Linguistic Objects, paving the way for universally accessible object
      oriented descriptions. We demonstrate a method for automatically transforming
      real world objects and their corresponding simulations into language simulable
      worlds using LLMMs, thus advancing the digital twin concept. This process can
      then be extended to high level programming languages, making the implementation
      of these simulations more accessible and practical. In summary, our research
      introduces a groundbreaking approach to connect linguistic objects in LLMMs
      with high level programming languages, allowing for the efficient implementation
      of real world simulations. This ultimately contributes to the realization of
      Digital Nature, where digital and physical worlds are interconnected, and objects
      and simulations can be effortlessly manipulated through computational means.",

      "We study the paradoxical aspects of closed time-like curves and their impact
      on the theory of computation. After introducing the $\\text{TM}_\\text{CTC}$,
      a classical Turing machine benefiting CTCs for backward time travel, Aaronson
      et al. proved that $\\text{P} = \\text{PSPACE}$ and the $\\Delta_2$ sets, such
      as the halting problem, are computable within this computational model. Our
      critical view is the physical consistency of this model, which leads to proposing
      the strong axiom, explaining that every particle rounding on a CTC will be destroyed
      before returning to its starting time, and the weak axiom, describing the same
      notion, particularly for Turing machines. We claim that in a universe containing
      CTCs, the two axioms must be true; otherwise, there will be an infinite number
      of any particle rounding on a CTC in the universe. An immediate result of the
      weak axiom is the incapability of Turing machines to convey information for
      a full round on a CTC, leading to the proposed $\\text{TM}_\\text{CTC}$ programs
      for the aforementioned corollaries failing to function. We suggest our solution
      for this problem as the data transferring hypothesis, which applies another
      $\\text{TM}_\\text{CTC}$ as a means for storing data. A prerequisite for it
      is the existence of the concept of Turing machines throughout time, which makes
      it appear infeasible in our universe. Then, we discuss possible physical conditions
      that can be held for a universe containing CTCs and conclude that if returning
      to an approximately equivalent universe by a CTC was conceivable, the above

      and Turing reducibility in the Calculus of Inductive Constructions (CIC), the
      constructive type theory underlying the Coq proof assistant. As usual in synthetic
      approaches, we employ a definition of oracle computations based on meta-level
      functions rather than object-level models of computation, relying on the fact
      that in constructive systems such as CIC all definable functions are computable
      by construction. Such an approach lends itself well to machine-checked proofs,
      which we carry out in Coq. There is a tension in finding a good synthetic rendering
      of the higher-order notion of oracle computability. On the one hand, it has
      to be informative enough to prove central results, ensuring that all notions
      are faithfully captured. On the other hand, it has to be restricted enough to
      benefit from axioms for synthetic computability, which usually concern first-order
      objects. Drawing inspiration from a definition by Andrej Bauer based on continuous
      functions in the effective topos, we use a notion of sequential continuity to
      characterise valid oracle computations. As main technical results, we show that
      Turing reducibility forms an upper semilattice, transports decidability, and
      is strictly more expressive than truth-table reducibility, and prove that whenever

      "title": "Reinforcement Learning Neural Turing Machines", "abstract": "The expressive
      power of a machine learning model is closely related to the number of sequential
      computational steps it can learn. For example, Deep Neural Networks have been
      more successful than shallow networks because they can perform a greater number
      of sequential computational steps (each highly parallel). The Neural Turing
      Machine (NTM) [8] is a model that can compactly express an even greater number
      of sequential computational steps, so it is even more powerful than a DNN. Its
      memory addressing operations are designed to be differentiable; thus the NTM
      can be trained with backpropagation. While differentiable memory is relatively
      easy to implement and train, it necessitates accessing the entire memory content
      at each computational step. This makes it difficult to implement a fast NTM.
      In this work, we use the Re inforce algorithm to learn where to access the memory,
      while using backpropagation to learn what to write to the memory. We call this
      model the RL-NTM. Reinforce allows our model to access a constant number of
      memory cells at each computational step, so its implementation can be faster.
      The RL-NTM is the first mo del that can, in principle, learn programs of unbounded
      running time. We successfully trained the RL-NTM to solve a number of algorithmic
      tasks that are simpler than the ones solvable by the fully differentiable NTM.
      As the RL-NTM is a fairly intricate model, we needed a method for verifying
      the correctness of our implementation. To do so, we developed a simple technique

      "abstract": "One of the main problems encountered so far with recurrent neural
      networks is that they struggle to retain long-time information dependencies
      in their recurrent connections. Neural Turing Machines (NTMs) attempt to mitigate
      this issue by providing the neural network with an external portion of memory,
      in which information can be stored and manipulated later on. The whole mechanism
      is differentiable end-to-end, allowing the network to learn how to utilise this
      long-term memory via stochastic gradient descent. This allows NTMs to infer
      simple algorithms directly from data sequences. Nonetheless, the model can be
      hard to train due to a large number of parameters and interacting components
      and little related work is present. In this work we use NTMs to learn and generalise
      two arithmetical tasks: binary addition and multiplication. These tasks are
      two fundamental algorithmic examples in computer science, and are a lot more
      challenging than the previously explored ones, with which we aim to shed some

      "title": "Sub-Turing Islands in the Wild", "abstract": "Recently, there has
      been growing debate as to whether or not static analysis can be truly sound.
      In spite of this concern, research on techniques seeking to at least partially
      answer undecidable questions has a long history. However, little attention has
      been given to the more empirical question of how often an exact solution might
      be given to a question despite the question being, at least in theory, undecidable.
      This paper investigates this issue by exploring sub-Turing islands -- regions
      of code for which a question of interest is decidable. We define such islands
      and then consider how to identify them. We implemented Cook, a prototype for
      finding sub-Turing islands and applied it to a corpus of 1100 Android applications,
      containing over 2 million methods. Results reveal that 55\\% of the all methods
      are sub-Turing. Our results also provide empirical, scientific evidence for
      the scalability of sub-Turing island identification. Sub-Turing identification
      has many downstream applications, because islands are so amenable to static
      analysis. We illustrate two downstream uses of the analysis. In the first, we
      found that over 37\\% of the verification conditions associated with runtime
      exceptions fell within sub-Turing islands and thus are statically decidable.
      A second use of our analysis is during code review where it provides guidance
      to developers. The sub-Turing islands from our study turns out to contain significantly
      fewer bugs than `theswamp'' (non sub-Turing methods). The greater bug density
      in the swamp is unsurprising; the fact that bugs remain prevalent in islands
      is, however, surprising: these are bugs whose repair can be fully automated.",

      to be called the Turing test, the ability of a machine to pass this test has
      established itself as the primary hallmark of general AI. To pass the test,
      a machine would have to be able to engage in dialogue in such a way that a human
      interrogator could not distinguish its behaviour from that of a human being.
      AI researchers have attempted to build machines that could meet this requirement,
      but they have so far failed. To pass the test, a machine would have to meet
      two conditions: (i) react appropriately to the variance in human dialogue and
      (ii) display a human-like personality and intentions. We argue, first, that
      it is for mathematical reasons impossible to program a machine which can master
      the enormously complex and constantly evolving pattern of variance which human
      dialogues contain. And second, that we do not know how to make machines that
      possess personality and intentions of the sort we find in humans. Since a Turing
      machine cannot master human dialogue behaviour, we conclude that a Turing machine
      also cannot possess what is called ``general'''' Artificial Intelligence. We

      "abstract": "Deep learning has achieved impressive results in many areas of
      Computer Vision and Natural Language Pro- cessing. Among others, Visual Question
      Answering (VQA), also referred to a visual Turing test, is considered one of
      the most compelling problems, and recent deep learning models have reported
      significant progress in vision and language modeling. Although Artificial Intelligence
      (AI) is getting closer to passing the visual Turing test, at the same time the
      existence of adversarial examples to deep learning systems may hinder the practical
      application of such systems. In this work, we conduct the first extensive study
      on adversarial examples for VQA systems. In particular, we focus on generating
      targeted adversarial examples for a VQA system while the target is considered
      to be a question-answer pair. Our evaluation shows that the success rate of
      whether a targeted adversarial example can be generated is mostly dependent
      on the choice of the target question-answer pair, and less on the choice of
      images to which the question refers. We also report the language prior phenomenon
      of a VQA model, which can explain why targeted adversarial examples are hard
      to generate for some question-answer targets. We also demonstrate that a compositional
      VQA architecture is slightly more resilient to adversarial attacks than a non-compositional
      one. Our study sheds new light on how to build deep vision and language resilient

      model. Then, in his investigations on its computational power, Wiedermann showed
      that FTM is able to solve undecidable problems. His suggested FTM structure,

      "abstract": "Graphs are an essential part of many machine learning problems
      such as analysis of parse trees, social networks, knowledge graphs, transportation
      systems, and molecular structures. Applying machine learning in these areas
      typically involves learning the graph structure and the relationship between
      the nodes of the graph. However, learning the graph structure is often complex,
      particularly when the graph is cyclic, and the transitions from one node to
      another are conditioned such as graphs used to represent a finite state machine.
      To solve this problem, we propose to extend the memory based Neural Turing Machine
      (NTM) with two novel additions. We allow for transitions between nodes to be
      influenced by information received from external environments, and we let the
      NTM learn the context of those transitions. We refer to this extension as the
      Conditional Neural Turing Machine (CNTM). \nWe show that the CNTM can infer
      conditional transition graphs by empirically verifiying the model on two data
      sets: a large set of randomly generated graphs, and a graph modeling the information
      retrieval process during certain crisis situations. The results show that the

      "This paper aims to question the suitability of the Turing Test, for testing
      machine intelligence, in the light of advances made in the last 60 years in
      science, medicine, and philosophy of mind. While the main concept of the test
      may seem sound and valid, a detailed analysis of what is required to pass the
      test highlights a significant flow. Once the analysis of the test is presented,
      a systematic approach is followed in analysing what is needed to devise a test
      or tests for intelligent machines. The paper presents a plausible generic framework
      based on categories of factors implied by subjective perception of intelligence.
      An evaluative discussion concludes the paper highlighting some of the unaddressed

      Such domain-specific challenges make it difficult to capture information reliably

      of Coverage Adjusted Standardized Mutual Information (CASMI). The main advantages

      help of an improved entropy estimator, particularly when the sample size is
      small, and 2) it automatically learns the number of features to be selected
      based on the information from sample data. Additionally, the proposed method
      handles feature redundancy from the perspective of joint-distribution. The proposed
      method focuses on non-ordinal data, while it works with numerical data with
      an appropriate binning method. A simulation study comparing the proposed method

      "title": "Taking Turing by Surprise? Designing Digital Computers for morally-loaded
      contexts", "abstract": "There is much to learn from what Turing hastily dismissed
      as Lady Lovelace s objection. Digital computers can indeed surprise us. Just
      like a piece of art, algorithms can be designed in such a way as to lead us
      to question our understanding of the world, or our place within it. Some humans
      do lose the capacity to be surprised in that way. It might be fear, or it might
      be the comfort of ideological certainties. As lazy normative animals, we do
      need to be able to rely on authorities to simplify our reasoning: that is ok.
      Yet the growing sophistication of systems designed to free us from the constraints
      of normative engagement may take us past a point of no-return. What if, through
      lack of normative exercise, our moral muscles became so atrophied as to leave
      us unable to question our social practices? This paper makes two distinct normative
      claims: \n1. Decision-support systems should be designed with a view to regularly
      jolting us out of our moral torpor. \n2. Without the depth of habit to somatically
      anchor model certainty, a computer s experience of something new is very different
      from that which in humans gives rise to non-trivial surprises. This asymmetry
      has key repercussions when it comes to the shape of ethical agency in artificial
      moral agents. The worry is not just that they would be likely to leap morally
      ahead of us, unencumbered by habits. The main reason to doubt that the moral
      trajectories of humans v. autonomous systems might remain compatible stems from
      the asymmetry in the mechanisms underlying moral change. Whereas in humans surprises
      will continue to play an important role in waking us to the need for moral change,
      cognitive processes will rule when it comes to machines. This asymmetry will
      translate into increasingly different moral outlooks, to the point of likely
      unintelligibility. The latter prospect is enough to doubt the desirability of
      autonomous moral agents.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2018, "referenceCount":

      understanding by machines progresses rapidly, we are observing an increasing
      interest in holistic architectures that tightly interlink both modalities in

      Machine has two implicit properties that depend on its underlying notion of
      computing: the format is fully determinate and computations are information
      preserving. Distributed representations lack these properties and cannot be
      fully captured by Turing''s standard model. To address this limitation a distributed
      extension of the Turing Machine is introduced in this paper. In the extended
      machine, functions and abstractions are expressed extensionally and computations
      are entropic. The machine is applied to the definition of an associative memory,
      with its corresponding memory register, recognition and retrieval operations.
      The memory is tested with an experiment for storing and recognizing hand written
      digits with satisfactory results. The experiment can be seen as a proof of concept
      that information can be stored and processed effectively in a highly distributed
      fashion using a symbolic but not fully determinate format. The new machine augments
      the symbolic mode of computing with consequences on the way Church Thesis is
      understood. The paper is concluded with a discussion of some implications of
      the extended machine for Artificial Intelligence and Cognition.", "venue": "arXiv.org",

      solved sequential problems requiring long-term memory, which are intractable

      access to memory can be encoded geometrically through a HyperNEAT-based Neural
      Turing Machine (HyperENTM). We demonstrate that using the indirect HyperNEAT
      encoding allows for training on small memory vectors in a bit-vector copy task
      and then applying the knowledge gained from such training to speed up training
      on larger size memory vectors. Additionally, we demonstrate that in some instances,
      networks trained to copy bit-vectors of size 9 can be scaled to sizes of 1,000
      without further training. While the task in this paper is simple, these results
      could open up the problems amendable to networks with external memories to problems
      with larger memory vectors and theoretically unbounded memory sizes.", "venue":

      either simply in binary form \"true/false\" (to a polar query) or in an accurate
      natural language description (to a non-polar query). Queries, polar or non-polar,
      consist of view-based queries which can be answered from a particular camera
      view and scene-centered queries which involves joint inference across different
      cameras. The story lines are collected to cover spatial, temporal and causal

      different vision modules, a knowledge base and a query engine. The system provides
      unified interfaces for different modules so that individual modules can be reconfigured
      to test a new method. We provide a benchmark dataset and a toolkit for ontology
      guided story-line query generation which consists of about 93.5 hours videos
      captured in four different locations and 3,426 queries split into 127 story
      lines. We also provide a baseline implementation and result analyses.", "venue":
