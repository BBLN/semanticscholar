        a finite sequence of axioms (the \"Rumpfsystem\") each of which makes a certain
        assertion with regard to the funda mental concepts employed, appears a final
        axiom seemingly concerning the preceding axioms and not related to the fundamental
        concepts of the system. The best known such axiom-system is that of Hilbert
        for Euclidean geometry, with its famous \"Axiom of Completeness.\" Whether
        the final axiom states that no more inclusive system of things exists which
        satisfies the preceding\u2014and is therefore a \"maximal\" axiom\u2014or
        is analogously a \"minimal\" axiom, such a final axiom will be called an \"extremal\"
        axiom. The authors defend the use of such axioms under suitable restrictions
        and when properly stated and interpreted. A fundamental concept in the study
        of axiomatics is the notion of isomorphism which the authors extend, by the
        concept of correlators which are binary relations between given n-ary relations.
        Complete isomorphism is discussed with respect to types of like speci fied
        order. If any two structures satisfying the \"Rumpfsystem\" are completely
        isomorphic as to elements of specified order, one may then inquire as to whether
        such a structure does or does not have a proper substructure isomorphic with
        it. Distinction is made between extensions of model and ex tension of structure.
        The legitimate introduction of the extremal axiom corresponds to the selection
        of extremal structures. The question of independence of the axioms in the
        \"Rumpfsystem\" as affected by the introduction of an extremal postulate is
        discussed and various cases are found to occur. A final serious question arises
        with regard to extension to a system of different order-type, as occurs from
        the system of rational numbers to that of real numbers regarded as sequences
        of rationals. Tarski''s restriction to an increase of one unit in order type
        has many attractive features, and avoids certain serious difficulties, but
        is found to be somewhat too restrictive.", "venue": "Journal of Symbolic Logic

        have been given to express an exact meaning corresponding to the intuitive
        idea of \u2018effective calculability\u2019 as applied for instance to functions
        of positive integers. The purpose of the present paper is to show that the
        computable functions introduced by the author are identical with the \u03bb-definable
        functions of Church and the general recursive functions due to Herbrand and
        G\u00f6del and developed by Kleene. It is shown that every \u03bb-definable
        function is computable and that every computable function is general recursive.
        There is a modified form of \u03bb-definability, known as \u03bb-K-definability,
        and it turns out to be natural to put the proof that every \u03bb-definable
        function is computable in the form of a proof that every \u03bb-K-definable
        function is computable; that every \u03bb-definable function is \u03bb-K-definable
        is trivial. If these results are taken in conjunction with an already available
        proof that every general recursive function is \u03bb-definable we shall have
        the required equivalence of computability with \u03bb-definability and incidentally
        a new proof of the equivalence of \u03bb-definability and \u03bb-K-definability.
        A definition of what is meant by a computable function cannot be given satisfactorily
        in a short space. I therefore refer the reader to Computable pp. 230\u2013235
        and p. 254. The proof that computability implies recursiveness requires no

        theory of conversion it is important to have a formally defined function which
        assigns to any positive integer n the least integer not less than n which
        has a given property. The definition of such a formula is somewhat involved:
        I propose to give the corresponding formula in \u03bb-K-conversion, which
        will (naturally) be much simpler. I shall in fact find a formula \u00fe such
        that if T be a formula for which T(n) is convertible to a formula representing
        a natural number, whenever n represents a natural number, then \u00fe(T, r)
        is convertible to the formula q representing the least natural number q, not
        less than r, for which T(q) conv 0.2 The method depends on finding a formula
        \u0398 with the property that \u0398 conv \u03bbu\u00b7u(\u0398(u)), and consequently
        if M\u2192\u0398(V) then M conv V(M). A formula with this property is, The
        formula \u00fe will have the required property if \u00fe(T, r) conv r when
        T(r) conv 0, and \u00fe(T, r) conv \u00fe(T, S(r)) otherwise. These conditions
        will be satisfied if \u00fe(T, r) conv T(r, \u03bbx\u00b7\u00fe(T, S(r)),
        r), i.e. if \u00fe conv {\u03bbptr\u00b7t(r, \u03bbx\u00b7p(t, S(r)), r)}(\u00fe).
        We therefore put, This enables us to define also a formula, such that (T,

        "structions, can be regarded as a kind of Turing machine. I t is thus immediately
        clear that computability, so defined, can be identified with (especially,
        is no less general than) the notion of effectiveness as it appears in certain
        mathematical problems (various forms of the Entscheidungsproblem, various
        problems to find complete sets of invariants in topology, group theory, etc.,
        and in general any problem which concerns the discovery of an algorithm).
        The principal result is that there exist sequences (well-defined on classical
        grounds) which are not computable. In particular the deducibility problem
        of the functional calculus of first order (Hilbert and Ackermann''s engere
        Funktionenkalkiil) is unsolvable in the sense that, if the formulas of this
        calculus are enumerated in a straightforward manner, the sequence whose nth
        term is 0 or 1, according as the nth formula in the enumeration is or is not
        deducible, is not computable. (The proof here requires some correction in
        matters of detail.) In an appendix the author sketches a proof of equivalence
        of \"computability\" in his sense and \"effective calculability\" in the sense
        of the present reviewer {American journal of mathematics, vol. 58 (1936),
        pp. 345-363, see review in this JOURNAL, vol. 1, pp. 73-74). The author''s
        result concerning the existence of uncomputable sequences was also anticipated,
        in terms of effective calculability, in the cited paper. His work was, however,
        done independently, being nearly complete and known in substance to a number
        of persons at the time that the paper appeared. As a matter of fact, there
        is involved here the equivalence of three different notions: computability
        by a Turing machine, general recursiveness in the sense of Herbrand-Godel-Kleene,
        and X-definability in the sense of Kleene and the present reviewer. Of these,
        the first has the advantage of making the identification with effectiveness
        in the ordinary (not explicitly defined) sense evident immediately\u2014i.e.
        without the necessity of proving preliminary theorems. The second and third
        have the advantage of suitability for embodiment in a system of symbolic logic.",

        as a kind of Turing machine. I t is thus immediately clear that computability,
        so defined, can be identified with (especially, is no less general than) the
        notion of effectiveness as it appears in certain mathematical problems (various
        forms of the Entscheidungsproblem, various problems to find complete sets
        of invariants in topology, group theory, etc., and in general any problem
        which concerns the discovery of an algorithm). The principal result is that
        there exist sequences (well-defined on classical grounds) which are not computable.
        In particular the deducibility problem of the functional calculus of first
        order (Hilbert and Ackermann''s engere Funktionenkalkiil) is unsolvable in
        the sense that, if the formulas of this calculus are enumerated in a straightforward
        manner, the sequence whose nth term is 0 or 1, according as the nth formula
        in the enumeration is or is not deducible, is not computable. (The proof here
        requires some correction in matters of detail.) In an appendix the author
        sketches a proof of equivalence of \"computability\" in his sense and \"effective
        calculability\" in the sense of the present reviewer {American journal of
        mathematics, vol. 58 (1936), pp. 345-363, see review in this JOURNAL, vol.
        1, pp. 73-74). The author''s result concerning the existence of uncomputable
        sequences was also anticipated, in terms of effective calculability, in the
        cited paper. His work was, however, done independently, being nearly complete
        and known in substance to a number of persons at the time that the paper appeared.
        As a matter of fact, there is involved here the equivalence of three different
        notions: computability by a Turing machine, general recursiveness in the sense
        of Herbrand-Godel-Kleene, and X-definability in the sense of Kleene and the
        present reviewer. Of these, the first has the advantage of making the identification
        with effectiveness in the ordinary (not explicitly defined) sense evident
        immediately\u2014i.e. without the necessity of proving preliminary theorems.

        Cultures of Saprolegnia", "abstract": "In almost all mycological work it is
        essential to secure and to maintain pure cultures of the fungi being investigated.
        Yet in many cases, cultures of the fungi, free from bacteria, are extremely
        difficult to obtain. This preliminary step in an investigation is often tedious
        and disproportionately time-consuming and hence the major objective of one''s
        research is often long delayed. The Saprolegniaceae, as a group, are especially
        troublesome to isolate. This difficulty arises because of the following conditions:
        these fungi occur in nature accompanied by large numbers of bacteria; usually
        the fungi themselves are slower in growing than the bacteria; the fungi, when
        grown on agar, are surrounded by a liquid film, by means of which the bacteria
        readily accompany the hyphae; the fungi do not grow satisfactorily in the
        presence of the commonly used bacterial inhibitors; the fungi have temperature
        and water requirements similar to those of bacteria. Each of these conditions
        adds to the difficulty of isolation by the common method of repeated transfer,
        since the hyphae invariably are ac? companied by adhering bacteria. The methods
        which have been employed in obtaining pure cul? tures of the Saprolegniaceae
        were ably reviewed by Kauffman (4). These methods as well as those more recently
        developed not only for the Saprolegniaceae but also for other fungi, may be
        roughly classified as either mechanical or chemical.", "venue": "", "year":

        "ture on the absorption spectrum will not be so great as at the lower pressure
        of the emission layer. We may assume curve (c) of figure 4 to represent with
        sufficient accuracy the radiation coming to the surface from a cold atmosphere,
        but not the radiation leaving the atmosphere a t high levels. From observations
        of polar continental air at low temperatures, it becomes possible to place
        an upper limit on the amount of radiation that leaves the atmosphere by way
        of the emission layer. A surface temperature of -60'' C., which has commonly
        been observed in Alaska and Siberia, corresponds to an equilibrium temperature
        of -34'' C. for the isothernial layer above it.\" From the difference between
        curves (a) and (c) of figure 4, the net loss of radiation to space froni the
        surface is found to be 0.054 gni cal/cm2/niin. The loss to space from the
        emission layer must not exceed this amount, for otherwise the atmosphere could
        not cool and at the same time preserve a stable lapse rate in lower levels.
        An even lower limit can be placed on the radiation if we notice that the isothermal
        layer in sounding (a), figure 1, of the writer''s previous paper, ha.s a temperature
        of -41'' C., corresponding to an equilibrium surface temperature of -66''
        C. In this case the net loss of ra.diation froni the surface is 0.044 gm cnl/cm2/min.,
        which is mi upper limit to the loss of radiation from the emission layer.
        In conclusion, it therefore appears t,lia,t model B is more sa tisfactory
        for computations which involve atniospheiic radiation thsn is model A. Furthermore,
        the nieasureinents of Weber and Randall, and the effects of low tempera.ture
        a.nd pressure on absorption, together inchate that the atniosphe,re is more
        t,ranspa.rent t80 long-wave radia.tion than formerly thought; and this is

        "title": "A System for Correlation of Land Forms and Covers with Soil Classification",
        "abstract": "This country is most fortunate, in having an established scheme
        of soil classification which has been in effect and has been applied on actual
        surveys throughout all parts of the country during a considerable number of
        years. It is also fortunate in that the scheme is flexible and applicable
        to all degrees of detail and to all scales of field mapping. It is but logical,
        therefore, that this system of soil classification should be incorporated
        in any scheme for evaluating the dominant factors which affect land use, whether
        for purposes of land classification or for the direct utilitarian purpose
        of developing soil conservation measures. When the Soil Erosion Service (later
        the Soil Conservation Service) launched the first soil conservation projects,
        it was necessary to establish principles and to develop procedures to attain
        the desired objectives. At the very outset, it was adopted as a cardinal principle
        of the organization that soil conservation plans should be predicated upon
        an inventory of those factors which are of dominant importance in land use.
        Since these conservation plans had to be made for each field of each farm
        within the project area and had to conform to variations in conditions which
        \u2022would affect the conservation plans even within a field, it was essential
        that the inventory of the dominant factors affecting conservation be shown
        in place on a detailed map of each farm. Thus, each area delineated on the
        farm maps, whether an entire field or parts of a field, received an evaluation
        of each of the four factors shown by the survey. While the immediate objective
        of the survey was directly utilitarian in that soil conservation plans were
        developed at once for each farm in accordance with the findings of the survey,
        the surveys furnished also a valuable accumulation of data which were rendered
        more valuable for analyses of the physical factors, influencing land use because
        they were shown in detail and in place. Thus, when the survey of any project
        area \u00b1s completed, whether 25,000 or 200,000 ''acres, the conditions
        of any one factor can be summarized for the area as a whole, or can be analyzed
        in relationship to each other, or to all other factors. The analyses of these
        conditions can in turn be correlated with farm management surveys or other
        farm studies. The factors which are considered to be of dominant''importance
        in soil conservation, and hence, the ones shown by the inventory, listed in
        the order in which they will be discussed hereafter, are four in number, as
        follows: (l) soil type; (2) present land use or ground cover; (3) slope; and
        (4) character and degree of erosion. Since these four factors are shown for
        each field, and usually for different parts of one field, it is necessary
        to delineate upon a large-scale map, each field and each area within which
        any one of the four factors varies. This entails the construction of large-scale
        accurate base maps. It has been found that the most satisfactory base maps
        upon which to show all of the detail desired are aerial survey pic\u2014 tures,
        particularly since recent photographs show much of the information desired,
        such as cover, drainage, roads, buildings, fences fences, gullies, and, to
        a certain extent, other erosion conditions, such as severe sheet or wind erosion.
        There has been marked development in aerial''photography in the last few years.
        Mr. Marshall Wright, in charge of Cartography in the Soil Conservation Service,
        has delivered a paper here, telling of the progress made in that field. Costs

        "title": "The General Nature and Applicability of Index Numbers for Education",
        "abstract": "Contrary to the belief held by many persons, index numbers are
        not re stricted to the realm of general econom ics, but are serviceable in
        many fields, and are equally well adapted to problems which do not directly
        involve money in any way. Index numbers have received a wider use in the field
        of education than is generally recognized. Perhaps their varied use in educational
        problems is not better known because they have not been expressly treated
        in educational litera ture as a technique of general applica bility. The procedure
        has been borrowed from economic3 and applied to education al problems by individual
        workers with out attention having been called explicit ly to the nature of
        the adaptations that have been made, and to the possibilities of further use,
        both for immediate serv ice and for research. It is the purpose of this article
        to make a beginning in this direction. It will discuss some of the general
        characteristics of index num bers, ^ and refer to the uses that have been
        made of them in education. The index number technique af fords an important
        means of indexing (measuring) complex variation. It is especially adapted
        to measuring changes in phenomena which cannot be objectively identified except
        in terms of several component or resultant elements. To take a common example,
        the concept, \"cost of living\", is an abstraction which does not exist as
        a concrete en tity, and cannot be dealt with directly as a single object.
        Its status depends upon the many variable elements which compose it. The same
        thing is true with regard to many of our concepts of quali ties or properties
        of logically complex phenomena?i.e., those which comprise a number of different
        kinds of elements. If one desires to measure such a character as \"cost of
        living\", or \"size\" of school systems, or \"general goodness\" of school
        systems, one theoretically has four courses open to him: (l) he can rely on
        a single selected characteristic which can be directly measured or count ed,
        to represent the general character;", "venue": "", "year": 1936, "referenceCount":

        were made on dogs in order to ascer-tain whether or not the heat-tachypnoea
        of the reflex nature is still causable after removing the centers for the
        body temperature regulat-ing mechanism, as that of the central nature, such
        as is elicitable by warming the carotid arteries. By raising the environmental
        temperature, the dog, without nar-cotizing, reacted by heat-tachypnoea; at
        its onset the body tempera-ture was usually normal or a little decreased,
        or only slightly raised, as well known. The corpus striatum, the thalamus
        opticus, and the tuber cine-rum were removed; no narcosis was used, and about
        one hour was. allowed to elapse before the next warming experiment for recovery
        from the operative shock. Afterwards no heat-tachypnoea of the reflex nature
        was elicited. contrary to that of the central origin. Some acceleration in
        the re-spiratory rate was always preceded by a material rise of the body temperature;
        that is, there was no evidence of heat-tachypnoea of the reflex nature occurring.
        In the majority of cases where some considerable tachypnoea, such as 90-200
        breathing per min., appeared after the brain opera-tion on raising the environmental
        temperature or on warming the -carotid arteries (S ato and Nemoto), whereby
        the body temperature was raised, the brain lesion was identical in essential
        points to that causable by the decerebration of Sherrington. This shows: So
        far as the midbrain remains nearly intact or even if the anterior col-liculi
        be excluded, although the brain portions anteriorto it be wholly removed or
        destroyed, the heat-tachypn oea is capable of being brought about by raising
        the temperature thereof or the body temperature. From the above outcome it
        may be justifiable to conclude: (1) The central mechanism for regulating the
        body temperature is indispensable for causing the heat-tachypnoea of the reflex
        origin. (2) The heat-tachypnoea of the central origin is induciable if the
        brain anterior to the midbrain or even the anterior colliculi are excluded.",

        character, anything should be said, it is perhaps to the point that the author,
        in discussing the rational process of lawmaking, has not clearly indicated
        the extent to which the development of law in modern times has been a rationalization
        of things accomplished in the social and economic fields. Specifically, the
        claim so often made that the laws of England and America have safeguarded
        personal and property rights is farfetched. A critical analysis would indicate
        that personal liberty and property rights were rather outgrowths of the struggle
        for the free market. In fact, in the light of the modern wage slavery, the
        emphasis in English and American theory on rights in the abstract is to all
        intents and purposes an absurdity, which the author fails to see. It is difficult
        to understand why a clearer critique of this position has been omitted. To
        the layman reading the book, the defects in evaluation, emphasis, and interpretation
        are unimportant when set alongside of its rational message and clarity of

        "The writer''s interest in children''s litera ture, particularly in its relation
        to character education, led to an attempt to consider the value of the fable
        as an aid toward the devel opment of character. It seemed probable that experimentation
        would show something of the degree to which children might be influenced toward
        choosing correct alternatives in life situations through suggestions emanating
        di rectly or indirectly from literature. In order that the experiment could
        be resolved in fairly precise terms, an effort was made to arrive at a measure
        of accuracy in determin ing the influence of the fable (as taught in elementary
        schools) on the child''s moral judgment. Such a study seemed to answer a definite
        need in present-day character education, par ticularly since the fable was
        not only found to be included in the Syllabus of the New York City Board of
        Education from the sec ond through the fourth grades, but also ap peared in
        the Syllabi of elementary school systems in many other American cities. So
        far as could be ascertained, no study of the possible scope and influence
        of the fable on character education has been made. Apart from a validation
        of the fable''s worth as an instrument of character education, the consid
        eration of the proper methods of presenting the fable for this purpose seemed
        important.", "venue": "", "year": 1937, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount":

        have avoided preconceived theories, contenting themselves with a detailed

        is otherwise inevitably a dry, though rich, historical repast. Many readers
        will regret the failure to relate price fluctuations to monetary changes.

        "title": "A COMPARISON OF THE THERMAL EXPANSION OF USED SILICA BRICK FROM
        AN INSULATED AND AN UNINSULATED OPEN\u2010HEARTH FURNACE ROOF*", "abstract":
        "Measurements of the linear thermal expansion of different zones in the used
        silica roof brick whose composition and structure have been described by Harvey
        show that along the length of the brick there are two abrupt changes in expansion.
        The first, whose existence was predicted by Harvey and by Miller, coincides
        with the limit of penetration of iron oxide and arises from the fact that
        in the presence of iron oxide the silica, originally present as cristobalite,
        has been largely converted to tridymite, which has a different expansion.
        The limit of penetration of iron oxide is taken as that level at which the
        average temperature is 1100\u00b0C (2010\u00b0F), the temperature of the ternary
        eutectic in the system CaO-FeO-SiO2; consequently, the abrupt change in expansion,
        and therefore a zone of weakness, is to be expected after equilibrium has
        been established in any open-hearth roof brick whose cold end is below 1100\u00b0C
        (2010\u00b0F). The second change, which is also due to a discontinuity in
        the distribution of cristobalite, occurs at that level in the brick at which
        the average temperature was 1470\u00b0C (2080\u00b0F), the lower limit of
        the stable range for cristobalite. In each case the change in expansion arises
        directly from a difference in the length-change at the cristobalite inversion,
        which takes place at approximately 250\u00b0C (480\u00b0F), so that failure
        or spalling is most likely to occur when the roof is cooled below or heated
        through this temperature. The expansion data also show that the inversion
        temperature of cristobalite increases regularly with the temperature at which
        it was formed or at which it was brought to equilibrium. \n \nThe data obtained
        enable the determination of the average distribution of tempera ture through
        the brick in service, which, combined with existing data on thermal conductivity
        of silica brick, permits an estimation of the mean thermal conductivity of
        that part of the brick into which iron oxide has penetrated. This conductivity
        is greater than that of the rest of the brick and has a negative temperature
        coefficient in contrast to the positive coefficient for the unaltered part.",

        "title": "Local Growth Disturbances in Tuberculous Disease of the Knee-Joint
        in Children", "abstract": "Where a chronic state of irritation, in the form
        of an infectious pro\u00ad cess, exists about a growing joint with its ossifie
        centres and epiphyseal lines, one may often observe an excessive development
        at those centres of growth. As its clinical expression one finds in the growing
        child a meas\u00ad urably greater length on the diseased side than on the
        other. In connexion with tuberculosis of the knee-joint this has been briefly
        noted by SORELD E J E R I N E and SINDING-LARSEN, but in general no notice
        is taken of the symptom, not even in large clinical works. In the roentgenologic
        litera\u00ad ture equally little attention has been paid to it. I t is true
        that in 1916 FORSSELL, in a paper on tuberculosis of joints, illustrated the
        subject by an example (the case was of a wrist) and mentioned HAUDEK''S earlier
        at\u00ad tempts to utilise the growth disturbances about the diseased articulation
        as a means of diagnosis; but since then these phenomena have, as far as I
        can find, been almost entirely overlooked, even in otherwise important works
        on the clinic and roentgenology of the knee-joint. Considering the insufficiency
        of our other aids to diagnosis of knee-joint diseases \u2014 a matter particularly
        commented on at the Congress of Surgery in Copen\u00ad hagen, in 1935 \u2014
        I believe there is every reason to take HAUDEK''S old idea up again, and to
        give a concise representation of the growth disturb\u00ad ances in tuberculosis
        of the knee-joint in children. I t has been found that the knee-joint is the
        articulation in which phe\u00ad nomena of this order can best be demonstrated
        and registered. In the first place, already the normal rate of growth is greatest
        there, in the sec\u00ad ond place the acceleration of the growth is seemingly
        proportional to the normal growth in the epiphyseal lines. Furthermore the
        earliest symp\u00ad toms, according to SVEN JOHANSSON''S investigations, most
        often occur in", "venue": "", "year": 1936, "referenceCount": 5, "citationCount":

        "These bridges were framed and erected by a county bridge crew working under
        the supervision of the county surveyor, who also served as a highway supervisor.
        The bridge crew consisted of a foreman, a carpenter, a truck driver, and from
        one to three common laborers. They removed the old struc\u00ad ture, constructed
        the new one, and made all approach fills necessary to complete the structure
        in from two to five days time, the time depending on the size of the structure.
        I-beams were used for stringers on all structures having a span of fourteen
        feet or over, and the three-inch flooring was fastened to the I-beams with
        cleats which locked the in\u00ad dividual planks to the stringers and to each
        other. The road\u00ad way was determined by the type of road on which the
        struc\u00ad ture was built, and all structures on improved roads or roads
        which would be improved soon were constructed with not less than eighteen
        feet of roadway. These structures have proved very satisfactory and the construction
        of similar ones will be continued in the future. Their life is estimated,
        on the basis of the life of several old structures in the county, at a minimum

        lues, for which he was treated for six weeks in a hospital in Hamburg, seemingly,
        according to several afterexaminations, with good result. He has lived for
        four years in South America, and while there repeatedly had malaria, the last
        time in 1930. In that year he also had dysentery. For some months past he
        has been an inmate of an asylum for inebriates, from which he was admitted
        to the medical department of the Diacons'' Home with a transfer diagnosis
        of lumbago. The part of the anamnesis which refers to his bone disease was
        brought out only in answer to direct questioning after roentgenography had
        revealed the condition. This shows how little it had troubled him. For the
        last ten years he has had the feeling that his right leg was becoming shorter
        than its fellow, because it did not reach the ground when he stood upright.
        For seven to ten years it has felt heavier than the left, from the hip downward,
        and has caused him a feeling of tiredness, which would become painful on any
        severe effort. This pain caused him to notice a thickening above the ankle.
        Otherwise the anamnesis contains nothing of interest. His natural functions
        are in good order. Examination on entry, 23rd Oct., 1934. \u2014 The patient
        is stoutish, his face somewhat bloodshot. He admits that he has been drinking
        a good deal, but denies being an alcoholist. The usual physical examina\u00ad
        tion showed normal conditions. Urine, normal. Blood pressure, 130/75. Pulse,
        68. During his stay in the hospital the variations in his tempera\u00ad ture
        were rather considerable: morning, 36.3\u00b0\u201436.5\u00b0; evening, 37.3\u00b0\u2014
