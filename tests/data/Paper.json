The definitions might be framed so as to reflect so far as possible the normal use of the words, but this attitude is dangerous. If the meaning of the words \u201cmachine\u201d and \u201cthink\u201d are to be found by examining how they are commonly used it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the meaning and the answer to the question, \u201cCan machines think?\u201d is to be sought in a statistical survey such as a Gallup poll.", "venue": "The Philosophy of Artificial Intelligence", "year": 1950, "referenceCount":

This study will tackle the optimization cycle by analyzing large amounts of usable data to create business opportunities. It provides a model for using Big Data Analytics to support service innovation and design. It is also a working framework for generating a business opportunities engine. It explains artificial intelligence (AI) and its contributions to creating business opportunities from big data and how it helps in improving the strategic planning structure. The study concluded that AI and machine learning added prediction and opportunity values to business data. It also clarifies that AI enriches the experience of business suggestions not only by predicting the best business ideas but also by recommending the best personnel and companies as investors for their preferred project ideas. This study extends the vision to create a smart business operating system. This includes scoring (ideas, financial status, the existence of opportunities, etc.), advice, and intelligent links between Venture capital and start-up prospects. This process is based on a variety of market analytics assisted by several elements of the application, such as corporate social networks, Score framework, recommendation, and geolocation analyzer, and quality developers for (Quality Proposal), business experience developer, competitiveness analyzer, plan predictions and forecasting.

Conventional SR suffers from two fundamental issues which we address in this work. First, since the number of possible equations grows exponentially with complexity, typical SR methods search the space stochastically and hence do not necessarily \ufb01nd the best function. In many cases, the target problems of SR are suf\ufb01ciently simple that a brute-force approach is not only feasible, but desirable. Second, the criteria used to select the equation which optimally balances accuracy with simplicity have been variable and poorly motivated. To address these issues we introduce a new method for SR \u2013 Exhaustive Symbolic Regression (ESR) \u2013 which systematically and ef\ufb01ciently considers all possible equations and is therefore guaranteed to \ufb01nd not only the true optimum but also a complete function ranking. Utilising the minimum description length principle, we introduce a principled method for combining these preferences into a single objective statistic. To illustrate the power of ESR we apply it to a catalogue of cosmic chronometers and the Pantheon+ sample of supernovae to learn the Hubble rate as a function of redshift, \ufb01nding \u223c 40 functions (out of 5.2 million considered) that \ufb01t the data more economically than the Friedmann equation.

It also explores the students' perspectives regarding the role of AI in medical education as a subject in the curriculum and a teaching tool. Methods This is a cross-sectional study using an online survey consisting of close-ended questions. The survey targets medical students at all medical levels across the 7 medical schools in Lebanon. Results A total of 206 medical students responded. When assessing AI knowledge sources (81.1%) got their information from the media as compared to (9.7%) from medical school curriculum. However, Students who learned the basics of AI as part of the medical school curriculum were more knowledge about AI than their peers who did not. Students in their clinical years appear to be more knowledgeable about AI in medicine. The advancements in AI affected the choice of specialty of around a quarter of the students (26.8%). Finally, only a quarter of students (26.5%) want to be assessed by AI, even though the majority (57.7%) reported that assessment by AI is more objective. Conclusions Education about AI should be incorporated in the medical school curriculum to improve the knowledge and attitudes of medical students. Improving AI knowledge in medical students will in turn increase acceptance of AI as a tool in medical education, thus unlocking its potential in revolutionizing medical education.", "venue": "Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 17, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Education", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-11-02", "journal": {"volume": "5", "name": "Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2161995683", "name": "George Doumat"}, {"authorId": "2114932610", "name": "Darine Daher"}, {"authorId": "1844338348", "name": "Nadim N Ghanem"}, {"authorId": "5735112", "name": "Beatrice Khater"}]}, {"paperId": "b5fe4cd533bdbbe877341040c6323bc4beea3610", "externalIds": {"DBLP": "journals/cim/LiWDW22", "DOI": "10.1109/MCI.2022.3199622", "CorpusId": 253423814}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b5fe4cd533bdbbe877341040c6323bc4beea3610", "title": "Meta-Learning for Fast and Privacy-Preserving Source Knowledge Transfer of EEG-Based BCIs", "abstract": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are used in many applications, due to their low-risk, low-cost, and convenience.

AI with its different subsidiaries, i.e. deep learning and machine learning, examine a large amount of data and performs an essential part in decision-making in addition to conquering the limitations related to human evaluation. Deep learning tries to imitate the functioning of the human brain. It utilizes much more data and intricate algorithms. Machine learning is AI based on automated learning. It utilizes earlier given data and uses algorithms to arrange and identify models. Globally, hepatocellular carcinoma is a major cause of illness and fatality. Although with substantial progress in the whole treatment strategy for hepatocellular carcinoma, managing it is still a major issue. AI in the area of gastroenterology, especially in hepatology, is particularly useful for various investigations of hepatocellular carcinoma because it is a commonly found tumor, and has specific radiological features that enable diagnostic procedures without the requirement of the histological study. However, interpreting and analyzing the resulting images is not always easy due to change of images throughout the disease process. Further, the prognostic process and response to the treatment process could be influenced by numerous components. Currently, AI is utilized in order to diagnose, curative and prediction goals. Future investigations are essential to prevent likely bias, which might subsequently influence the analysis of images and therefore restrict the consent and utilization of such models in medical practices.

This paper proposes a novel two-stage solution to achieve the best of both worlds: \ufb01rst to train a deep RL agent, then distill its (over-)parameterized NN policy into white-box, light-weight rules in the form of symbolic expressions that are much easier to understand and to implement in constrained environments. At the core of our proposal is a novel symbolic branching algorithm that enables the rule to be aware of the context in terms of various network conditions, eventually converting the NN policy into a symbolic tree. The distilled symbolic rules preserve and often improve performance over state-of-the-art NN policies while being faster and simpler than a standard neural network. We validate the performance of our distilled symbolic rules on both simulation and emulation environments.

Typically, an auto-regressive (AR) method is adopted for generating texts in a token-by-token manner. Despite many advantages of AR generation, it usually suffers from inefficient inference. Therefore, nonautoregressive (NAR) models are proposed to generate all target tokens simultaneously. However, NAR models usually generate texts of lower quality due to the absence of token dependency in the output text. In this paper, we propose ELMER: an Efficient and effective PLM for NAR tExt geneRation to explicitly model the token dependency during NAR generation. By leveraging the early exit technique, ELMER enables the token generations at different layers, according to their prediction confidence (a more confident token will exit at a lower layer). Besides, we propose a novel pre-training objective, Layer Permutation Language Modeling, to pre-train ELMER by permuting the exit layer for each token in sequences. Experiments on three text generation tasks show that ELMER significantly outperforms NAR models and further narrows the performance gap with AR PLMs (e.g., ELMER (29.92) vs BART (30.61) ROUGE-L in XSUM) while achieving over 10 times inference speedup.", "venue": "ArXiv", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 46, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-10-24", "journal": {"volume": "abs/2210.13304", "name": "ArXiv"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2018027", "name": "Junyi Li"}, {"authorId": "1997234792", "name": "Tianyi Tang"}, {"authorId": "2542603", "name": "Wayne Xin Zhao"}, {"authorId": "50204644", "name": "J.

Fast and accurate diagnostic methods for COVID-19 detection play a vital role in containing the plague. Chest computed tomography (CT) is one of the most commonly used diagnosis methods. However, a complete CT-scan has hundreds of slices, and it is time-consuming for radiologists to check each slice to diagnose COVID-19. This study introduces a novel method for fast and automated COVID-19 diagnosis using the chest CT scans. The proposed models are based on the state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, and a 2D global max pooling (globalMaxPool2D) layer is used to improve the performance. We compare the proposed models to the existing state-of-the-art deep learning models such as CNN based models and vision transformer (ViT) models. Based off of metric such as area under curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and false discovery rate (FDR), experimental results show that the proposed models outperform the previous methods, and the best model achieves an area under curve of 0.9744 and accuracy 94.12% on our test datasets. It is also shown that the accuracy is improved by around 1% by using the 2D global max pooling layer. Moreover, a heatmap method to highlight the lesion area on COVID-19 chest CT images is introduced in the paper. This heatmap method is helpful for a radiologist to identify the abnormal pattern of COVID-19 on chest CT images. In addition, we also developed a freely accessible online simulation software for automated COVID-19 detection using CT images.

New technologies are therefore needed to increase the efficiency, probability of detection, and interpretability of NDE methods to establish smart inspection. In this context, Artificial intelligence (AI), as a fundamental component of the Industry 4.0, is a well-suited tool to address downsides associated with the current NDE methods for analysis and interpretation of inspection results, where methods integrating AI into their inspection process become automated and are known as smart inspection methods. This article sheds a light on the conventional methods and the smart techniques used in defects detection. Subsequently, a comparison between the two notions is presented. Furthermore, it investigates opportunities for the integration of non-destructive evaluation (NDE) methods and Industry 4.0 technologies.

High-strength composites, on the other hand, especially aramid fiber-reinforced polymers (AFRP), are not suitable for conventional machining operations due in part to high operational costs and limited surface quality characterized by fuzziness and delamination. Abrasive Water Jet (AWJ) has been recently shown promising results in obtaining improved surface quality while ensuring significant cost advantages. This study investigates the AWJ processing of AFRP by implementing the analysis of variance and response surface methods. The effects of the control parameters (sand ratio, pressure, stand-off-distance, and feed rate) on the surface quality metrics (surface roughness, kerf angle, and dimensional error) are identified and comparatively evaluated. The surface quality of the AWJ processed AFRP specimens are investigated using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The trade-offs between the measured tolerances and surface roughness values are identified via a new genetic algorithm approach: Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-III). Also, operation regions are determined using the generated Pareto curves while improving the quality of various features of an AFRP component, critical to its functional performance during extended service life. As a result, the lowest Ra values obtained were 4.135\u2005\u00b5m for trimming, 5.962\u2005\u00b5m for pocketing, and 4.696\u2005\u00b5m for the hole-making operation.

In particular, epistemic errors in model inputs may well exert a very strong control over how accurate we might expect model predictions to be when compared against evaluation data that might also be subject to epistemic uncertainties. We suggest that both modellers and referees should treat model validation as a form of Turing\u2010like Test, whilst being more explicit about how the uncertainties in observed data and their impacts are assessed.

We support the argument with an interview study conducted with three AI experts who had all organized game jams with a focus on using AI in game development.

While AI appears \"smart\" to the public, and may outperform humans on specific tasks, the truth is that today\u2019s AI lacks insight beyond the restricted scope of problems to which it has been tasked. Without context, AI is effectively incapable of comprehending the true nature of what it does and is oblivious to the reverberations it may cause in the real world should it err in prediction. Despite this, future AI may be equipped with enough sensors and neural processing capacity to acquire a dynamic cognizance more akin to humans. If this materializes, will autonomous agents question their own position in this world? One must entertain the possibility that this is not merely hypothetical but may, in fact, be imminent if humanity succeeds in creating artificial general intelligence (AGI).If autonomous agents with the capacity for artificial consciousness are delegated grueling tasks, outcomes could mirror the plight of exploited workers, result in retaliation, failure to comply, alternative objectives, or breakdown of human-autonomy teams. It will be critical to decide how and in which contexts various agents should be utilized. Additionally, delineating the meaning of trust and ethical consideration between humans and machines is problematic because descriptions of trust and ethics have only been detailed in human terms. This means autonomous agents will be subject to anthropomorphism, but robots are not humans, and their experience of trust and ethics might be markedly distinct from humans. Ideally speaking, to fully entrust a machine with human-centered tasks, one must believe that such an entity is reliable, competent, has the appropriate priorities in decision-making, and can comprehend the consequences of actions taken. Such qualities may depend on conscious awareness\u2014but without first deciphering what consciousness is in the first place, humans may fail to accurately identify consciousness in machines.This work explores the foundations of consciousness from the perspective of evolutionary biologists, neuroscientists, and philosophers, and strives to position degrees of consciousness in a trust and ethical consideration framework to guide AI usage and research. To mitigate foreseeable risks in autonomy, the authors seek to spark dialogue and preventative action, so proper legal and operational requirements can be established prior to any agent acquiring even an inkling of consciousness.

In this paper we study the newly discovered phenomenon in the foundations of computational mathematics: generalised hardness of approximation (GHA) \u2013 which in spirit is close to classical HA in computer science. However, GHA is typically independent of the P vs. NP question in many cases. Thus, it requires a new mathematical framework that we initiate in this paper. We demonstrate the hitherto undiscovered phenomenon that GHA happens when using AI techniques in order to train optimal neural networks (NNs). In particular, for any non-zero underdetermined linear problem the following phase transition may occur: One can prove the existence of optimal NNs for solving the problem but they can only be computed to a certain accuracy \u01eb 0 > 0 . Below the approximation threshold \u01eb 0 \u2013 not only does it become intractable to compute the NN \u2013 it becomes impossible regardless of computing power, and no randomised algorithm can solve the problem with probability better than 1/2.

That's why solar energy has a vital role in alternative energy resources. Solar energy sources will gain more importance in the future. As it is known, the most needed type of energy today is electrical energy. Thus, in this study, the necessary conditions for the photovoltaic (PV) systems used in solar energy production to operate at maximum performance and which parameters are required to control these conditions are examined. The results show that four parameters that we need to measure. These are: maximum operating current of a panel/cell (Impp), maximum operating voltage of a panel/cell (Vmpp), panel surface temperature and light intensity falling on the panel. Except for the panel surface temperature, the rest of the parameters can be measured directly. However, affecting the panel surface temperature; we must not ignore parameters such as ambient temperature, wind speed, humidity and light intensity. Therefore, while determining the panel surface temperature, these parameters should also be measured and a surface temperature should be determined accordingly.", "venue": "2022 Innovations in Intelligent Systems and Applications Conference (ASYU)", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 59, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Engineering", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-09-07", "journal": {"pages": "1-6", "name": "2022 Innovations in Intelligent Systems and Applications Conference (ASYU)"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "92836991", "name": "\u0130.

Federated Learning (FL) is a type of distributed Deep Learning framework, in which the model is trained locally on each device and the trained gradients are sent to a central server which aggregates them and creates a global model. This helps ensure the data privacy of the user as the data never leaves the local device. However, this dependency on the central server can lead to various issues such as lack of transparency and communication bottleneck. Making this process decentralized can help address these issues. In this review, a detailed survey on using blockchain in federated learning is presented. This review also focuses on how can we use blockchain to make federated learning more transparent and decentralized to protect the privacy of the user.

Plankton offer worthy yet tractable biological targets for digital twinning, due to their relatively simply physiology and significant role in ecology from theoretical studies through to planetary scale biogeochemistry. Construction of dynamic plankton DT (PDT), representing a supreme test of our understanding of plankton ecophysiology, would form the basis of education and training aids, provide platforms for hypothesis setting/testing, experiment design and interpretation, and support the construction and testing of large-scale ecosystem models and allied management tools. PDTs may be constructed using concepts from systems biology, with system dynamics, including feedback controls akin to biological (de)repression processes, to provide a robust approach to model plankton, with flexible core features enabling ready and meaningful configuration of phenotypic traits. Expert witness validation through Turing Tests would provide confidence in the end product. Through deployment of PDTs with appropriate input controls and output (visualization) tools, empiricists are more likely to engage with modelling, enhancing future science and increasing confidence in predictive operational and also in long-term climate simulations.", "venue": "Journal of Plankton Research", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 75, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-08-30", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Plankton Research"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "34976063", "name": "K.

The paper explores HRPs' beliefs in a legal and financial context, performance management issues, and the impact of automation on the decision-making process. Furthermore, the authors perform a cross-cultural comparison analysis to examine potential significant differences between cultural clusters.FindingsHRPs are aware of how technology adoption is affecting work environment and they highlight the importance of human resources (HR) for businesses, despite the global trend of extensive machinery exploitation. Interestingly, our results suggest that overall globalization, common knowledge, and internationalized practices lead to homogeneity for most issues under study.Originality/valueTo the best of the authors' knowledge, there has not been any comprehensive study exploring and analyzing the effects of Industry 4.0 on HRPs perceptions in the context of a dynamic HR environment influenced by technological transformation.

The adopted image vision diagnostic protocol was structured in the following steps: image acquisition by selecting the best zoom level of the microscope; preliminary selection of an image with a good resolution; preliminary identification of macro-areas of defect in each preselected image; identification of a class of a defect in the selected macro-area; training of the supervised machine learning FRF algorithm by selecting the micro-defect in the macro-area; execution of the FRF algorithm to find an image vision performance indicator; and analysis of the output images by enhancing lesion defects. The precision achieved by the FRF algorithm proved to be appropriate with a discordance of 17% with respect to the dermatopathologist, allowing this type of supervised algorithm to be nominated as a help to the dermatopathologist in the challenging diagnosis of malignant melanoma.", "venue": "Diagnostics", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 24, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-08-01", "journal": {"volume": "12", "name": "Diagnostics"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1471633507", "name": "Gerardo Cazzato"}, {"authorId": "144275192", "name": "A.

However, in the era of automation, there is still a dearth of works focused on one of the most relevant use cases, i.e., tutoring dialog systems that can help students learn new subjects or topics of their interest. Most of the previous works in this domain are either rule based systems which require a lot of manual efforts or are based on multiple choice type factual questions. In this paper, we propose EDICA (Educational Domain Infused Conversational Agent), a language tutoring Virtual Agent (VA). EDICA employs two mechanisms in order to converse fluently with a student/user over a question and assist them to learn a language: (i) Student/Tutor Intent Classification (SIC-TIC) framework to identify the intent of the student and decide the action of the VA, respectively, in the on-going conversation and (ii) Tutor Response Generation (TRG) framework to generate domain infused and intent/action conditioned tutor responses at every step of the conversation.

Special attention has been given to the premise that self-organized criticality (SOC) is a fundamental property of neural system. SOC provides a competitive model to describe the physical mechanisms underlying spontaneous brain activity, and thus, critical dynamics were proposed as general gauges of information processing representing a strong candidate for a surrogate measure of consciousness. As SOC could be a neurodynamical framework, which may be able to bring together existing theories and experimental evidence, the purpose of this work was to provide a comprehensive overview of progress of research on SOC in association with consciousness. Methods A comprehensive search of publications on consciousness and SOC published between 1998 and 2021 was conducted. The Web of Science database was searched, and annual number of publications and citations, type of articles, and applied methods were determined. Results A total of 71 publications were identified. The annual number of citations steadily increased over the years. Original articles comprised 50.7% and reviews/theoretical articles 43.6%. Sixteen studies reported on human data and in seven studies data were recorded in animals. Computational models were utilized in n\u2009=\u200912 studies. EcoG data were assessed in n\u2009=\u20094 articles, fMRI in n\u2009=\u20094 studies, and EEG/MEG in n\u2009=\u200910 studies. Notably, different analytical tools were applied in the EEG/MEG studies to assess a surrogate measure of criticality such as the detrended fluctuation analysis, the pair correlation function, parameters from the neuronal avalanche analysis and the spectral exponent. Conclusion Recent studies pointed out agreements of critical dynamics with the current most influencing theories in the field of consciousness research, the global workspace theory and the integrated information theory. Thus, the framework of SOC as a neurodynamical parameter for consciousness seems promising. However, identified experimental work was small in numbers, and a heterogeneity of applied analytical tools as a surrogate measure of criticality was observable, which limits the generalizability of findings.", "venue": "Frontiers in psychology", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 153, "citationCount": 1, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-07-15", "journal": {"volume": "13", "name": "Frontiers in Psychology"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2106198405", "name": "Nike Walter"}, {"authorId": "1812411", "name": "T.

The SARS-CoV-2 has caused significant problems to medical systems and healthcare facilities due to its unexpected global expansion. Despite all of the efforts, developing effective treatments, diagnostic techniques, and vaccinations for this unique virus is a top priority and takes a long time. However, the foremost step in vaccine development is to identify possible antigens for a vaccine. The traditional method was time taking, but after the breakthrough technology of reverse vaccinology (RV) was introduced in 2000, it drastically lowers the time needed to detect antigens ranging from 5\u201315 years to 1\u20132 years. The different RV tools work based on machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). Models based on AI and ML have shown promising solutions in accelerating the discovery and optimization of new antivirals or effective vaccine candidates. In the present scenario, AI has been extensively used for drug and vaccine research against SARS-COV-2 therapy discovery. This is more useful for the identification of potential existing drugs with inhibitory human coronavirus by using different datasets.

This review explores nascent technologies that promise more convergence. A novel form of artificial intelligence classifies objects according to sensory percepts during active exploration and decides on efficient sequences of exploratory actions to identify objects. Representing objects according to the collective experience of manipulating them provides a substrate for discovering causality and affordances. Such concepts that generalize beyond explicit training experiences are an important aspect of human intelligence that has eluded robots. For robots to acquire such knowledge, they will need an extended period of active exploration and manipulation similar to that employed by infants. The efficacy, efficiency and safety of such behaviors depends on achieving smooth transitions between movements that change quickly from exploratory to executive to reflexive. Animals achieve such smoothness by using a hierarchical control scheme that is fundamentally different from those of conventional robotics. The lowest level of that hierarchy, the spinal cord, starts to self-organize during spontaneous movements in the fetus. This allows its connectivity to reflect the mechanics of the musculoskeletal plant, a bio-inspired process that could be used to adapt spinal-like middleware for robots. Implementation of these extended and essential stages of fetal and infant development is impractical, however, for mechatronic hardware that does not heal and replace itself like biological tissues. Instead such development can now be accomplished in silico and then cloned into physical robots, a strategy that could transcend human performance.", "venue": "Frontiers in Robotics and AI", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 103, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-07-05", "journal": {"volume": "9", "name": "Frontiers in Robotics and AI"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1720471", "name": "G.

The development of deep-learning algorithms to detect the presence of disease may contribute to sufficient screening, early detection, and timely treatment for this preventable blinding disease. This review aimed to systematically examine the literature in AI algorithms in detecting ROP. Specifically, we focused on the performance of deep-learning algorithms through sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) for both the detection and grade of ROP. METHODS: We searched Medline OVID, PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase for studies published from January 1, 2012, to September 20, 2021. Studies evaluating the diagnostic performance of deep-learning models based on retinal fundus images with expert ophthalmologists' judgment as reference standard were included. Studies which did not investigate the presence or absence of disease were excluded. Risk of bias was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool. RESULTS: Twelve studies out of the 175 studies identified were included. Five studies measured the performance of detecting the presence of ROP and seven studies determined the presence of plus disease. The average AUROC out of 11 studies was 0.98. The average sensitivity and specificity for detecting ROP was 95.72% and 98.15%, respectively, and for detecting plus disease was 91.13% and 95.92%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The diagnostic performance of deep-learning algorithms in published studies was high. Few studies presented externally validated results or compared performance to expert human graders. Large scale prospective validation alongside robust study design could improve future studies.", "venue": "Saudi journal of ophthalmology : official journal of the Saudi Ophthalmological Society", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 48, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-07-01", "journal": {"volume": "36", "pages": "296 - 307", "name": "Saudi Journal of Ophthalmology"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2188462264", "name": "Amelia Bai"}, {"authorId": "2147403082", "name": "Christopher Carty"}, {"authorId": "145230414", "name": "S.

However, attempts to bring together research on expertise and eye tracking methodology provoke several challenges, because visual information processes should be studied in authentic and domain-specific environments. Among the barriers to designing appropriate research are the proper definition of levels of expertise, the tension between internal (experimental control) and external (authentic environments) validity, and the appropriate methodology to study eye movements in a three-dimensional environment. This exploratory study aims to address these challenges and to provide an adequate research setting by investigating visual expertise in sculpting. Eye movements and gaze patterns of 20 participants were investigated while looking at two sculptures in a museum. The participants were assigned to four different groups based on their level of expertise (laypersons, novices, semi-experts, experts). Using mobile eye tracking, the following parameters were measured: number of fixations, duration of fixation, dwell time in relevant areas, and revisits in relevant areas. Moreover, scan paths were analysed using the eyenalysis approach. Conclusions are drawn on both the nature of visual expertise in sculpting and the potential (and limitations) of empirical designs that aim to investigate expertise in authentic environments.", "venue": "Journal of Eye Movement Research", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 45, "citationCount": 1, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Business", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-06-30", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Eye Movement Research"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1562175910", "name": "Isabell Stein"}, {"authorId": "2838193", "name": "Helen Jossberger"}, {"authorId": "1577977568", "name": "H.

The goal of an open domain dialogue system is to imitate humans in conversations. Previous works on single turn conversation generation have greatly promoted the research of open domain dialogue systems. However, understanding multiple single turn conversations is not equal to the understanding of multi turn dialogue due to the coherent and context dependent properties of human dialogue. Therefore, in open domain multi turn dialogue generation, it is essential to modeling the contextual semantics of the dialogue history, rather than only according to the last utterance. Previous research had verified the effectiveness of the hierarchical recurrent encoder-decoder framework on open domain multi turn dialogue generation. However, using RNN-based model to hierarchically encoding the utterances to obtain the representation of dialogue history still face the problem of a vanishing gradient. To address this issue, in this paper, we proposed a static and dynamic attention-based approach to model the dialogue history and then generate open domain multi turn dialogue responses. Experimental results on Ubuntu and Opensubtitles datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed static and dynamic attention-based approach on automatic and human evaluation metrics in various experimental settings. Meanwhile, we also empirically verify the performance of combining the static and dynamic attentions on open domain multi turn dialogue generation.", "venue": "ACM Transactions on Information Systems", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 50, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-06-30", "journal": {"name": "ACM Journal of the ACM (JACM)"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1806419", "name": "Weinan Zhang"}, {"authorId": "3043830", "name": "Yiming Cui"}, {"authorId": "2153281320", "name": "Kaiyan Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2115568958", "name": "Yifa Wang"}, {"authorId": "50736467", "name": "Qingfu Zhu"}, {"authorId": "2145679703", "name": "Lingzhi Li"}, {"authorId": "2140034831", "name": "Ting Liu"}]}, {"paperId": "491a1b8d433e53b786c5d6971f8ff262634d3d79", "externalIds": {"ArXiv": "2206.14876", "CorpusId": 250144493}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/491a1b8d433e53b786c5d6971f8ff262634d3d79", "title": "AI in Asset Management and Rebellion Research", "abstract": "On October 30th, 2021, Rebellion Research\u2019s CEO announced in a Q3 2021 Letter to Investors that Rebellion\u2019s AI Global Equity strategy returned +6.8% gross for the first three quarters of 2021. \u201cIt\u2019s no surprise\u201d, Alex told us, \u201cour Machine Learning global strategy has a history of outperforming the S&P 500 for 14 years\u201d (see Exhibit 1).

We base this proposal on associating such capacities with the \u201cself,\u201d which we define as the \u201cenvironment-agent nexus\u201d; namely, a fine-tuned interaction of brain with environment in all its relevant variables. We consider richly adaptive architectures that have the potential to implement this interaction by taking lessons from the brain. In particular, we suggest conjoining the free energy principle (FEP) with the dynamic temporo-spatial (TSD) view of neuro-mental processes. Our proposed integration of FEP and TSD \u2013 in the implementation of artificial agents \u2013 offers a novel, expressive, and explainable way for artificial agents to adapt to different environmental contexts.

This specific talk dealt with \u2018The Future Role of AI in Warfare\u2019, and in this paper I propose a reading of Russell\u2019s address which both summarises and critiques his argument and stance, to determine what, if anything, can be taken from his position as effectively a public philosopher and applied in the realm of modern warfare, where ethical questions are taken from the seminar room and enacted in battlespace. The Reith lectures occupy a unique place in public discourse; given each year by a leading figure in the field under discussion, they help to shape opinion and debate. In considering the role of AI, and in particular its deployment in combat, there is undoubtedly a need for multi- and transdisciplinary thought, but the choice of Russell as the lecturer is not unproblematic. He is undoubtedly an expert in the field of AI, but he has no direct experience of working with the military, and is clearly not a neutral witness. He has been a leading figure in the campaign to ban research into autonomous weapon systems, and was closely involved in the production of Slaughterbots, a short film which presents a nightmare vision of swarming drones as agents of political repression. There are deep and serious questions to be asked about the role of AI in warfare, but Russell\u2019s position that we must stop all research in the field is arguably na\u00efve. Our adversaries will surely not be as punctilious. At the heart of the debate lie complex issues concerning human agency and control (and \u2018control\u2019 lies at the etymological root of \u2018cyber\u2019); this paper will use Russell\u2019s lecture as a starting point for the consideration of how we might develop an ethical doctrine for the use of AI, resting on the idea of human-machine teaming.

Current systems do not need to be conscious to recognize patterns and classify them. However, for AI to advance to the next level, it needs to develop capabilities such as metathinking, creativity, and empathy. We contend that such a paradigm shift is possible through a fundamental change in the state of artificial intelligence toward consciousness, similar to what took place for humans through the process of natural selection and evolution. To that end, we propose that consciousness in AI is an emergent phenomenon that primordially appears when two machines cocreate their own language through which they can recall and communicate their internal state of time-varying symbol manipulation. Because, in our view, consciousness arises from the communication of inner states, it leads to empathy. We then provide a link between the empathic quality of machines and better service outcomes associated with empathic human agents that can also lead to accountability in AI services.

An understanding of this capacity is central to several fields: the evolution of form and function, the design of effective strategies for biomedicine, and the creation of novel life forms via chimeric and bioengineering technologies. Here, we review instructive examples of living organisms solving diverse problems and propose competent navigation in arbitrary spaces as an invariant for thinking about the scaling of cognition during evolution. We argue that our innate capacity to recognize agency and intelligence in unfamiliar guises lags far behind our ability to detect it in familiar behavioral contexts. The multi-scale competency of life is essential to adaptive function, potentiating evolution and providing strategies for top-down control (not micromanagement) to address complex disease and injury. We propose an observer-focused viewpoint that is agnostic about scale and implementation, illustrating how evolution pivoted similar strategies to explore and exploit metabolic, transcriptional, morphological, and finally 3D motion spaces. By generalizing the concept of behavior, we gain novel perspectives on evolution, strategies for system-level biomedical interventions, and the construction of bioengineered intelligences.

The GPT-3 language model presents a level of advancement that allows it to generate texts as answers to general questions, as summaries of the presented text, etc., which reach the level surpassing the analogous level of human texts.

Every one of us is overly familiar with the phenomenon, but there is little agreement on what it is, what it entails, and how it is created. Certainly, no other phenomenon is simultaneously so familiar and so hard to explain. Researchers from fields as different as medicine, philosophy, psychology, neurobiology, and computer science have tried for centuries to frame, describe, and address the mind\u2013body problem\u2014how consciousness arises from purely physical processes\u2014but success has been, to say the least, limited. Many believe that it is a phenomenon that will remain, forever, unknowable, outside the reach of human understanding. David Chalmers (1) famously argued that, while we may advance in our understanding of the different physical processes that are associated with consciousness (the easy problems), we will never be able to understand the process that leads to subjective experiences (the hard problem), since understanding this phenomenon represents a challenge of an entirely different nature. Other theories, such as mysterianism, defend that, while the phenomenon may be understandable in principle, it will never be accessible to the human mind (2), due to intrinsic limitations of the human brain. Despite these difficulties, many scientists and philosophers have advanced tentative explanations for the phenomenon (3\u20135), and proposed ways to assess it (6), measure it (7), create it in machines (8), and even use it to improve the performance of artificial intelligence systems (9). The paper by Blum and Blum (10), in PNAS, approaches the problem from an engineering perspective, by showing how a specific computational architecture, which they have proposed (11), can explain several phenomena that are closely related to consciousness.", "venue": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 23, "citationCount": 1, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Philosophy", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-05-24", "journal": {"volume": "119", "name": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1706641", "name": "Arlindo L.

Transit time distributions of different shapes, mean residence times, and contributions are used to represent the hydrogeological conditions in aquifer systems and are typically inferred from measured tracer concentrations by inverse modeling. In this study, a multi\u2010tracer sampling campaign was conducted in the Salalah Plain in Southern Oman including CFCs, SF6, 39Ar, 14C, and 4He. Based on the data of three tracers, a two\u2010component Dispersion Model (DMmix) and a nonparametric model with six age bins were assumed and evaluated using Bayesian statistics. In a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach, the maximum likelihood parameter estimates and their uncertainties were determined. Model performance was assessed using Bayes factor and leave\u2010one\u2010out cross\u2010validation. Both models suggest that the groundwater in the Salalah Plain is composed of a very young component below 30 yr and a very old component beyond 1,000 yr, with the nonparametric model performing slightly better than the DMmix model.

First of all, on what Artificial Intelligence systems are able to do in the production of informative texts. This raises the question if and how an Artificial Intelligence software system can be treated as the author of a text it has produced. Evaluating whether this is correct and possible leads to re-examine the current conception for which it is taken for granted that the author is a person. This, in turn, when faced with texts produced by Artificial Intelligence systems necessarily raises the question of whether they, like the author-person, are endowed with agency.

However\u2014possibly because of its origins in the development of agents capable of self-discovery\u2014relatively little attention has been paid to the interaction between people and ML systems, although recent developments on Explainable ML are expected to address this, by providing visual and textual feedback on how the ML system arrived at a conclusion. In this paper we are concerned with the use of ML in automated or semi-automated tools that assist one or more human decision makers. We argue that requirements on both human and machine in this context are signi\ufb01cantly di\ufb00erent to the use of ML either as part of autonomous agents for self-discovery or as part statistical data analysis. Our principal position is that the design of such human-machine systems should be driven by repeated, two-way intelligibility of information rather than one-way explainability of the ML-system\u2019s recommendations. Iterated rounds of intelligible information exchange, we think, will characterise the kinds of collaboration that will be needed to understand complex phenomena for which neither man or machine have complete answers. To reassure the reader that this is not simply wordplay, we propose operational principles\u2013we call them Intelligibility Axioms\u2013to guide the design of a \ufb01rst-step in constructing a collaborative decision-support system. Speci\ufb01cally, for one iteration in the collaboration (human-to-machine-to-human), the principles are intended to encode su\ufb03cient criteria for the following: (a) what it means for information provided by the human to be intelligible to the ML system; and (b) what it means for an explanation provided by an ML system to be intelligible to a human. Using examples from the literature on the use of ML for drug-design and in medicine, we demonstrate cases where the conditions of the axioms are met. Intelligibility of communication is necessary, but not su\ufb03cient to extend a single iteration of the collaborative loop to multiple iterations.

The exponential increases in computing power, open-source software, available data, and embedded services have been crucial to this success. At the same time, there is growing unease around whether the behavior of these systems can be rendered transparent, explainable, unbiased, and accountable. One consequence of recent AI accomplishments is a renaissance of interest around the ethics of such systems. More generally, our AI systems remain singular task-achieving architectures, often termed narrow AI. I will argue that artificial general intelligence-able to range across widely differing tasks and contexts-is unlikely to be developed, or emerge, any time soon.", "venue": "Daedalus", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 30, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-05-01", "journal": {"volume": "151", "pages": "28-42", "name": "Daedalus"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1705314", "name": "N.

With the advent of novel electronic and ionic components along with a deeper understanding of information pathways in living species, a plethora of opportunities to develop completely novel information processing avenues are within reach.

The dual importance of local learning rules is addressed, from spike timing dependent plasticity at the neuron level to the interwoven morphological and dynamical mechanisms of the global network. Basal biological principles are highlighted, including phylogenies, ontogenesis, and homeostasis, with particular emphasis on network topology and dynamics. While in machine learning system training is performed on virgin networks without any a priori knowledge, the approach proposed here distinguishes itself unambiguously by employing growth mechanisms as a guideline to design novel computing architectures.

From the viewpoint of AI basic research, the ability to play a game against a human has historically been adopted as a criterion of evaluation, as competition can be characterized by an algorithmic approach. Starting from the end of the 1990s, the deployment of sophisticated hardware identified a significant improvement in the ability of a machine to play and win popular games. In spite of the spectacular victory of IBM\u2019s Deep Blue over Garry Kasparov, many objections still remain. This is due to the fact that it is not clear how this result can be applied to solve real-world problems or simulate human abilities, e.g., common sense, and also exhibit a form of generalized AI. An evaluation based uniquely on the capacity of playing games, even when enriched by the capability of learning complex rules without any human supervision, is bound to be unsatisfactory. As the internet has dramatically changed the cultural habits and social interaction of users, who continuously exchange information with intelligent agents, it is quite natural to consider cooperation as the next step in AI software evaluation. Although this concept has already been explored in the scientific literature in the fields of economics and mathematics, its consideration in AI is relatively recent and generally covers the study of cooperation between agents. This paper focuses on more complex problems involving heterogeneity (specifically, the cooperation between humans and software agents, or even robots), which are investigated by taking into account ethical issues occurring during attempts to achieve a common goal shared by both parties, with a possible result of either conflict or stalemate.

Indeed, the paper argues that such claim is based on a series of misunderstanding over the very notion and functions of \u201clegal responsibility\u201d, which it then seeks to clarify by developing and interdisciplinary conceptual taxonomy. In doing so, it aims to set the premises for a more constructive debate over the feasibility of granting legal standing to robotic application. After a short Introduction setting the stage of the debate, the paper addresses the ontological claim, distinguishing the philosophical from the legal debate on the notion of i) subjectivity and ii) agency, with their respective implications. The analysis allows us to conclude that the attribution of legal subjectivity and agency are purely fictional and technical solutions to facilitate legal interactions, and is not dependent upon the intrinsic nature of the RAI. A similar structure is maintained with respect to the notion of responsibility, addressed first in a philosophical and then legal perspective, to demonstrate how the latter is often utilized to both pursue ex ante deterrence and ex post compensation. The focus on the second objective allows us to bridge the analysis towards functional (law and economics based) considerations, to discuss how even the attribution of legal personhood may be conceived as an attempt to simplify certain legal interactions and relations. Within such a framework, the discussion whether to attribute legal subjectivity to the machine needs to be kept entirely within the legal domain, and grounded on technical (legal) considerations, to be argued on a functional, bottom-up analysis of specific classes of RAI. That does not entail the attribution of animacy or the ascription of a moral status to the entity itself.", "venue": "Frontiers in Robotics and AI", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 171, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Law", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-04-05", "journal": {"volume": "9", "name": "Frontiers in Robotics and AI"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2071280576", "name": "A.

First three kinds of suffering are considered: physical, psychological, and existential. Physical pain is shown to be primarily subjective, and distinctive psychological and existential sufferings probably do exist, which are neither reducible to neurobiological events, nor replicable through algorithms. The current stage of SR research is then reviewed. Many creative proposals are presented, together with some philosophical and technical challenges posed by other scholars. I then offer my critique of SR research, claiming that it is based on a superficial understanding of suffering and unjustified philosophical presuppositions, namely, reductive physicalism. Without the capability to suffer, robots probably cannot love in any real sense, and no meaningful relationship may be developed between such a robot and a human. Therefore, we are probably unable to produce sentient robots that can become our companions (friends, lovers, etc.).", "venue": "The New bioethics : a multidisciplinary journal of biotechnology and the body", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 58, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Philosophy", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-04-03", "journal": {"volume": "28", "pages": "168 - 185", "name": "The New Bioethics"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2162526861", "name": "Zishang Yue"}]}, {"paperId": "cc0f9bdfce7f525c3de1a72cb24c61265c025190", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1080/19322909.2022.2060893", "CorpusId": 248079598}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cc0f9bdfce7f525c3de1a72cb24c61265c025190", "title": "Implementing a Chatbot on a Library Website", "abstract": "Abstract A library\u2019s website is a virtual point of contact for interacting with its patrons.

To our knowledge, no published report or protocol synthesizes the full breadth of stakeholder perspectives. The absence of such a rigorous foundation perpetuates the \u201cAI chasm,\u201d which continues to delay patient benefit. Objective The aim of this research is to synthesize stakeholder perspectives of computerized clinical decision support tools in any health care setting. Synthesized findings will inform future research and the implementation of AI into health care services. Methods The search strategy will use MEDLINE (Ovid), Scopus, CINAHL (EBSCO), ACM Digital Library, and Science Citation Index (Web of Science). Following deduplication, title, abstract, and full text screening will be performed by 2 independent reviewers with a third topic expert arbitrating. The quality of included studies will be appraised to support interpretation. Best-fit framework synthesis will be performed, with line-by-line coding completed by 2 independent reviewers. Where appropriate, these findings will be assigned to 1 of 22 a priori themes defined by the Nonadoption, Abandonment, Scale-up, Spread, and Sustainability framework. New domains will be inductively generated for outlying findings. The placement of findings within themes will be reviewed iteratively by a study advisory group including patient and lay representatives. Results Study registration was obtained from PROSPERO (CRD42021256005) in May 2021. Final searches were executed in April, and screening is ongoing at the time of writing. Full text data analysis is due to be completed in October 2021. We anticipate that the study will be submitted for open-access publication in late 2021. Conclusions This paper describes the protocol for a qualitative evidence synthesis aiming to define barriers and facilitators to the implementation of computerized clinical decision support tools from all relevant stakeholders. The results of this study are intended to expedite the delivery of patient benefit from AI-enabled clinical tools.

As the content stored in working memory gradually evolves, successive states overlap and are continuous with one another.

Study 1 examined the role of trust in the use of AI voice assistants based on survey responses from college students. A path analysis confirmed that trust had a significant effect on the intention to use AI, which operated through perceived usefulness and participants\u2019 attitude toward voice assistants. In Study 2, using data from a representative sample of the U.S. population, different dimensions of trust were examined using exploratory factor analysis, which yielded two dimensions: human-like trust and functionality trust. The results of the path analyses from Study 1 were replicated in Study 2, confirming the indirect effect of trust and the effects of perceived usefulness, ease of use, and attitude on intention to use. Further, both dimensions of trust shared a similar pattern of effects within the model, with functionality-related trust exhibiting a greater total impact on usage intention than human-like trust.

The purpose of this paper is to identify, discuss and provide suggestions for how ML could be included in research and education in the future for the management accountant.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThis paper identifies three types of studies on the influence of ML on MA issued between 2015 and 2021 in mainstream accounting journals, by professional accounting bodies and by large consulting companies.\n\n\nFindings\nFirst, only very few academic articles actually show examples of using ML or using different algorithms related to MA issues. This is in contrast to other research fields such as finance and logistics. Second, the literature review also indicates that if the management accountants want to keep up with the demand of their qualifications, they must take action now and begin to discuss how big data and other concepts from artificial intelligence and ML can benefit MA and the management accountant in specific ways.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nEven though the paper may be classified as inspirational in nature, the paper documents and discusses the revised environment that surrounds the accountant today. The paper concludes by highlighting specifically the necessity of including exploratory data analysis and unsupervised ML in the field of MA to close the existing gaps in both education and research and thus making the MA profession future-proof.\n", "venue": "Journal of Accounting &amp; Organizational Change", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 112, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Business", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-03-11", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Accounting &amp; Organizational Change"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2053600377", "name": "Steen Nielsen"}]}, {"paperId": "d7ce3e79413de753e95b519750416b7e4ff65e50", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1177/17456916211029942", "CorpusId": 247384096, "PubMed": "35271777"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d7ce3e79413de753e95b519750416b7e4ff65e50", "title": "Where\u2019s My Consciousness-Ometer?

In terms of technical application, AI art has two methods: symbolism and connectivism. In terms of the human-machine system, there are three levels: human using machine, human guiding machine and human-machine separation. AI art is a special form, existing between natural beauty and human art: AI art, first of all, is not a natural aesthetic object, given that it is the product of artefacts. Its appreciation is mixed with interests, and its artistic generation is a kind of \u201cpurposeful non-purposefulness.\u201d Secondly, AI art is not equal to traditional human art, because AI has no intentionality or consciousness. Thirdly, AI participates in the construction of artistic logic and breaks the boundary of traditional art. AI can be regarded as an \u201cagent\u201d in art generation, and together with people constitute the \u201cactor network\u201d of art. The processes of generation, identification and appreciation of AI art include the judgment of true and false.

Digital information management and communication technologies may support care coordination among caregivers. However, they have yet to be adopted in this context, partly because of issues with supporting long-term disease progression and caregiver anxiety. Voice assistant (VA) technology is a promising method for interfacing with digital health information that may aid in multiple aspects of being a caregiver, thereby influencing adoption. Understanding the expectations for VAs to support caregivers is fundamental to inform the practical development of this technology. Objective This study explored caregivers\u2019 perspectives on using VA technology to support caregiving and inform the design of future digital technologies in complex home care. Methods This study was part of a larger study of caregivers across North America on the design of digital health technologies to support health communication and information management in complex home care. Caregivers included parents, guardians, and hired caregivers such as personal support workers and home care nurses. Video interviews were conducted with caregivers to capture their mental models on the potential application of VAs in complex home care and were theoretically analyzed using the technology acceptance model. Interviews were followed up with Likert-scale questions exploring perspectives on other VA applications beyond participants\u2019 initial perceptions. Results Data were collected from 22 caregivers, and 3 themes were identified: caregivers\u2019 perceived usefulness of VAs in supporting documentation, care coordination, and person-centered care; caregivers\u2019 perceived ease of use in navigating information efficiently (they also had usability concerns with this interaction method); and caregivers\u2019 concerns, excitement, expected costs, and previous experience with VAs that influenced their attitudes toward use. From the Likert-scale questions, most participants (21/22, 95%) agreed that VAs should support prompted information recording and retrieval, and all participants (22/22, 100%) agreed that they should provide reminders. They also agreed that VAs should support them in an emergency (18/22, 82%)\u2014but only for calling emergency services\u2014and guide caregivers through tasks (21/22, 95%). However, participants were less agreeable on VAs expressing a personality (14/22, 64%)\u2014concerned they would manipulate caregivers\u2019 perceptions\u2014and listening ambiently to remind caregivers about their documentation (16/22, 73%). They were much less agreeable about VAs providing unprompted assistance on caregiving tasks (9/22, 41%). Conclusions The interviews and Likert-scale results point toward the potential for VAs to support family caregivers and hired caregivers by easing their information management and health communication at home. However, beyond information interaction, the potential impact of VA personality traits on caregivers\u2019 perceptions of the care situation and the passive collection of audio data to improve user experience through context-specific interactions are critical design considerations that should be further examined.", "venue": "JMIR human factors", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 68, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-03-03", "journal": {"volume": "9", "name": "JMIR Human Factors"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1947423581", "name": "R.

With the enhancement of machine learning algorithms and increased computational capabilities, machine learning has proved one of the most efficient cryptocurrency prediction methods. However, most studies focused on single digital currency prediction or small-scale algorithm comparison for multiple currencies. This study aims to present a comparative performance of large-scale selected Machine Learning algorithms for cryptocurrency forecasting. Specifically, this paper concentrates on forecasting time series data for a short-term trading period in ten cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, ADA, BNB, XRP, DOGE, LUNA, LINK, LTC, and BCH) with ten selected machine learning algorithms (Decision Tree, Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Bayesian Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Neural Networks, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machine).

Deep learning methods are then described in Section 2. We narrow down the focus of the study on textual data in Section 3, where natural language processing and its applications in the biomedical domain are described. In Section 4, we give an introduction to explainable artificial intelligence and discuss the importance of explainability of artificial intelligence systems, especially in the biomedical domain. 1. Artificial Intelligence Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a scientific field that studies computer systems performing tasks that need human intelligence. AI systems aim at doing intelligent tasks such as learning from experience, knowledge representation, problem solving, reasoning, perception, and natural language processing, which are associated with cognitive functions of human mind (Russell and Norvig, 2009). Nowadays, AI systems have many applications in a wide variety of domains such as education, medicine, transportation, military, entertainment, finance, autonomous driving, smartphones, agriculture, social media, economy, healthcare, law, manufacturing, cybersecurity, and many other domains. Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Explainable Artificial Intelligence in the Biomedical Domain 2 Since early work on artificial neurons in the 1940s (McCulloch and Pitts, 1943), different generations of AI methods have been developed. Alan Turing\u2019s theory of computation, the idea of a thinking machine, and the Turing test formed solid theoretical foundations and a milestone in early stages of development of machine intelligence in the 1950s (Turing, 1950). Then in the 1960s and 1970s, symbolic AI systems such as the General Problem Solver, the Geometry Theorem Prover, and the Logic Theorist employed high-level human-readable knowledge representation, logic programming, and reasoning to search for solutions to problems (Russell and Norvig, 2009). Knowledge-based and expert systems then became popular in the 1980s. This generation of AI systems leveraged more powerful, domain-specific knowledge (typically special-purpose rule sets in combination with customized inference methods) to solve problems in narrower fields of expertise. Meanwhile, connectionism was revived and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) moved the field forward towards performing more difficult and intelligent tasks, e.g. optical character recognition and speech recognition (Hopfield, 1988; Russell and Norvig, 2009). With the rapid adoption of Internet in the 1990s, AI tools such as recommender systems, search engines, and machine translation systems found their way into everyday life. ANNs are computational methods inspired by the biological nervous systems. A neural network consists of multiple layers of interconnected processing units called \u201cneurons\u201d that are able to perform parallel computations. They are mostly used for data processing and knowledge representation purposes (Ramesh et al., 2004). ANNs have become attractive data analytics tools since they have the capability of handling complex, non-linear data relationships. A typical neuron in an ANN receives inputs from the previous layer in the network, aggregates the inputs, applies an activation function, and produces a final output based on the activation function\u2019s output and a threshold. Since the advent of ANNs in the 1940s (McCulloch and Pitts, 1943), artificial neurons have evolved from simple binary threshold functions to complex non-linear processing units in CNNs, RNNs, and transformer models. In the first decades of the 21st century, availability of large volumes of data (known as \u201cbig data\u201d), extremely powerful processors specially designed to run floating-point arithmetic computation, novel multi-layer ANN architectures, and advanced machine learning techniques have led to the development of a new class of AI methods, called \u201cdeep learning\u201d (LeCun et al., 2015). Machine learning refers to a class of AI methods designed to learn data relationships hidden in a dataset of samples, and then generalize the learned knowledge to new unseen data samples. Accordingly, deep learning refers Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Explainable Artificial Intelligence in the Biomedical Domain 3 to a class of machine learning methods comprising multiple layers of processing units, designed to build complex generative or predictive models from large datasets. Modern deep neural networks, e.g. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), have been widely used to model complex data relationships for a wide variety of scientific and industrial applications (Khamparia and Singh, 2019). 1.1. Artificial Intelligence in biomedicine and healthcare AI systems have many applications in biomedical research and healthcare domains (Hamet and Tremblay, 2017; Min et al., 2017; Ramesh et al., 2004; Rav\u00ec et al., 2017). In many use-cases, AI methods have performed as accurate as human experts, even performed better than humans in some cases (Mintz and Brodie, 2019). ANNs are among the most widely-used AI methods utilized in the biomedical domain (Ramesh et al., 2004). Large amounts of data in the biomedical domain make demands for developing intelligent computer methods that facilitate automatic acquisition and analysis of knowledge that is necessary to solve problems in biology and medicine. Utilizing AI systems for medical applications dates back to the 1970s, when computer analysis helped clinicians diagnose acute abdominal pain (Gunn, 1976). Since many biological, clinical, and pathological variables involve in complex interactions in biomedical datasets, ANN and deep learning models have been extensively applied to data science problems in biology and medicine. One of the first applications of ANN for clinical decision making aimed at diagnosing acute myocardial infarction (Baxt, 1990). In clinical settings, AI systems have found many applications in diagnostic tasks such as image analysis in radiology and histopathology, waveform analysis, interpreting data in intensive care situation, and analysing Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), X-rays, and radioisotope scans (Amisha et al., 2019; Mintz and Brodie, 2019; Ramesh et al., 2004). AI methods have also had applications in clinical prognostic tasks such as identifying high risk patients, predicting survival chance in patients, and predicting outcome in patients with specific cancers (Ramesh et al., 2004). Another type of AI systems, i.e. AI-robots, have been used as assistant-surgeons or solo performers in surgery, or as care-bots for assisting in the delivery of care (Amisha et al., 2019; Hamet and Tremblay, 2017). They can be also used to monitor the guided delivery of drugs to target tumours, tissues, or organs (Hamet and Tremblay, 2017). In biomedical research, machine learning methods have had applications in discovering novel Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Explainable Artificial Intelligence in the Biomedical Domain 4 therapeutic targets using protein-protein interaction algorithms (Theofilatos et al., 2015), identifying DNA variants as predictors of a specific disease (Rapakoulia et al., 2014), Image and text are two data modalities in the biomedical domain that are commonly analysed using machine learning methods. AI-driven image processing have many applications in radiology, oncology, cardiology, gastroenterology, ophthalmology, etc. (Mintz and Brodie, 2019).

To answer this, we extend the visual question answering framework and propose the following behavioral test in the form of a two-player game. We consider black-box neural models of CLEVR. These models are trained on a diagnostic dataset benchmarking reasoning. Next, we train an adversarial player that re-configures the scene to fool the CLEVR model. We show that CLEVR models, which otherwise could perform at a \u201chuman level\u201d, can easily be fooled by our agent.

QNLP is a recent application of quantum computing that aims at representing sentences\u2019 meaning as vectors encoded into quantum computers. To achieve this, the distributional meaning of words is extended by the compositional meaning of sentences (DisCoCat model) : the vectors representing words\u2019 meanings are composed through the syntactic structure of the sentence. This is done using an algorithm based on tensor products. We see that this algorithm is inefficient on classical computers but scales well using quantum circuits. After exposing the practical details of its implementation, we go through three use-cases. First we show that the DisCoCat framework has been used to do sentence similarity. While its straightforward implementation using quantum nearest neighbor is theoretically possible, its full implementation requires quantum RAM, a technology not yet available. We therefore review a hybrid classicalquantum workflow that was proposed to overcome that technical limitation. It encodes the dataset into a single superposition state and the distances within the amplitudes of the superposition. Second, we show how the measured output of quantum circuits have been successfully used to do binary sentence classification. We see that sentences are mapped into quantum circuits with the use of parameters for rotation gates (Rx, Rz) which can be optimized classically for a given task and dataset (question-answering in our case). While this is the first QNLP algorithm implemented on a quantum computer, our replication of the experiments leads us to raise some concerns as to the model\u2019s universality and scalability. We also see solutions have been proposed to offer better scalability at the price of increasing the size of circuits. Finally, we see an extension that was proposed to encode hyperonomy (hierarchical word structure denoting supertype) using mixed states and ordering of positive operators. We see that when used within the DisCoCat framework, this model performs well at predicting sentence entailment While this thesis was designed to be a review of the literature about QNLP, we also introduce original experiments on question-answering. After replicating previous experiments on hand-labelled sentences, we extend the words\u2019 mappings to add coverage for logical connectors. These play a central role in compositionality as they allow to combine sentences in a way that the truth value of the whole is predictable from ones of its parts.

We outline some relevant historical developments that all rely on different forms of mimicry of human life or intelligence. Many such approaches have been to some extent successful. However, we want to argue that there are ways to exploit aspects of life-likeness without deception. A life-like robot has advantages in communicating with humans, not because we believe it to be alive, but rather because we react instinctively to certain aspects of life-like behavior as this can make a robot easier to understand and allows us to better predict its actions. Although there may be reasons for trying to design robots that look exactly like humans for specific research purposes, we argue that it is subtle behavioral cues that are important for understandable robots rather than life-likeness in itself. To this end, we are developing a humanoid robot that will be able to show human-like movements while still looking decidedly robotic, thus exploiting the our ability to understand the behaviors of other people based on their movements.", "venue": "Frontiers in Human Dynamics", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 52, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-02-22", "journal": {"volume": "4"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1732218", "name": "C.

Having to respond quickly to the increase in the courses activated, the company decided to develop a chatbot using a cloud-based service currently available on the market. These services are based on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) engines, which deal with identifying information such as entities and intentions from the sentences provided as input. To integrate a chatbot in an e-learning platform, we studied the performance of the intent recognition task of the major NLU platforms available on the market with an in-depth comparison, using an Italian dataset provided by the owner of the e-learning platform. We focused on intent recognition, carried out several experiments and evaluated performance in terms of F-score, error rate, response time, and robustness of all the services selected.

The pairing of structural health monitoring (SHM) and nondestructive evaluation (NDE) methods with ML algorithms has yielded beneficial results in addressing the damage state of a material or system. Damage state descriptions addressed with ML include detecting a damage mechanism, locating a mechanism, identifying the type of mechanism, assessing the extent of the damage mechanism, and estimating the useful remaining life of a material or system. Damage evaluation research of composite materials has progressed with the increased usage of composite structural elements in the aerospace industry. NDE methods are a viable candidate for pairing with ML algorithms to improve damage state monitoring of composite materials due to the complexity associated with the structure of composites. Fiber-reinforced polymers (FRP), for example, contain at least two constituent materials a fiber and matrix material whose mechanical behavior and interactions contribute to the performance of an FRP. Unlike conventional composite analytical models that require explicit information about the constituents and microstructure of a laminate, an ML algorithm can construct damage evaluation predictions when employing exclusively past operational performance or data from an SHM or NDE method. A researcher determines the type of data selected when applying an ML model for trend analysis, anomaly detection, or prediction making. However, no one specific input feature is required for utilizing an ML model, and examples of possible data features include material properties, physical dimensions, and collected evaluation data. In the present review, applications of ML combined with the damage state evaluation of composite materials, particularly examining FRPs, are discussed to demonstrate the predictive capabilities of ML and its viability for future applications, especially in industrial environments, to minimize costs and improve damage detection rates.", "venue": "Journal of Composite Materials", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 205, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Materials Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-02-18", "journal": {"volume": "56", "pages": "1417 - 1452", "name": "Journal of Composite Materials"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2037185590", "name": "Christopher Nelon"}, {"authorId": "49999858", "name": "O.

More than merely a technological function, however, it is also a social process whereby cultural assumptions about what emotions are and how they are made are translated into composites of code, software, and mechanical platforms that operationalise certain models of emotion over others. This essay illustrates how aspects of cultural difference are both incorporated and elided in projects that equip machines with emotional intelligence. It does so by comparing the field of affective computing, which emerged in the North-Atlantic in the 1990s, with kansei (affective) engineering, which developed in Japan in the 1980s. It then leverages this comparison to argue for more diverse applications of the culture concept in both the development and critique of systems with artificial emotional intelligence.

A series of studies have been carried out in recent years. In dialogue systems, researchers have explored driving a dialogue based on a plan, while in story generation, a storyline has also been proved to be useful. In this article, we address a new task\u2014generating movie scripts based on a predefined narrative. As an early exploration, we study this problem in a \u201cretrieval-based\u201d setting. We propose a model (ScriptWriter-CPre) to select the best response (i.e., next script line) among the candidates that fit the context (i.e., previous script lines) as well as the given narrative. Our model can keep track of what in the narrative has been said and what is to be said. Besides, it can also predict which part of the narrative should be paid more attention to when selecting the next line of script. In our study, we find the narrative plays a different role than the context. Therefore, different mechanisms are designed for deal with them. Due to the unavailability of data for this new application, we construct a new large-scale data collection GraphMovie from a movie website where end-users can upload their narratives freely when watching a movie. This new dataset is made available publicly to facilitate other studies in text generation under the guideline.

We call this \u2018retrospective learning\u2019. For example, an intelligence may see a set of pictures of objects, along with their names, and learn to name them. A retrospective learning intelligence would merely be able to name more pictures of the same objects. We argue that this is not what true intelligence is about. In many real world problems, both NIs and AIs will have to learn for an uncertain future. Both must update their internal models to be useful for future tasks, such as naming fundamentally new objects and using these objects effectively in a new context or to achieve previously unencountered goals. This ability to learn for the future we call \u2018prospective learning\u2019. We articulate four relevant factors that jointly define prospective learning. Continual learning enables intelligences to remember those aspects of the past which it believes will be most useful in the future. Prospective constraints (including biases and priors) facilitate the intelligence finding general solutions that will be applicable to future problems. Curiosity motivates taking actions that inform future decision making, including in previously unmet situations. Causal estimation enables learning the structure of relations that guide choosing actions for specific outcomes, even when the specific action-outcome contingencies have never been observed before. We argue that a paradigm shift from retrospective to prospective learning will enable the communities that study intelligence to unite and overcome existing bottlenecks to more effectively explain, augment, and engineer intelligences. \u201cNo man ever steps in the same river twice.

Computational models constitute a major stake in translational neuroscience: the analytical understanding of these models seems fundamental to consider a translation towards clinical applications. Method: We propose a minimal typology of computational models, which allows distinguishing between more realistic models (e.g., mechanistic models) and pragmatic models (e.g., phenomenological models). Result: Understanding the translational aspects of computational models goes far beyond the intrinsic characteristics of models. First, we assume that a computational model is rarely uniquely mechanistic or phenomenological. Idealization seems necessary because of i) the researcher\u2019s perspectives on the phenomena and the purposes of the study (i.e., by the relativity of the model); ii) The complexity of reality across different levels and therefore the nature and number of dimensions required to consider a phenomenon. Especially, the use of models goes far beyond their function, and requires considering external characteristics rooted in path dependence, interdisciplinarity, and pluralism in neurosciences. Conclusion: The unreasonable use of computational models, which are highly complex and subject to a shift in their initial function, could be limited by bringing to light such factors.", "venue": "", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 62, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-01-14", "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "116951279", "name": "C.

Machine learning and deep learning (DL) are subclasses of AI that show breakthrough performance in image analysis. They have become the state of the art in the field of image classification and recognition. Machine learning deals with the extraction of the important characteristic features from images, whereas DL uses neural networks to solve such problems with better performance. In this review, we discuss the current applications of machine learning and DL in the field of diagnostic radiology. Deep learning applications can be divided into medical imaging analysis and applications beyond analysis. In the field of medical imaging analysis, deep convolutional neural networks are used for image classification, lesion detection, and segmentation. Also used are recurrent neural networks when extracting information from electronic medical records and to augment the use of convolutional neural networks in the field of image classification. Generative adversarial networks have been explicitly used in generating high-resolution computed tomography and magnetic resonance images and to map computed tomography images from the corresponding magnetic resonance imaging. Beyond image analysis, DL can be used for quality control, workflow organization, and reporting. In this article, we review the most current AI models used in medical imaging research, providing a brief explanation of the various models described in the literature within the past 5 years.

In this work we compare five different crowdworker-based human evaluation methods and find that different methods are best depending on the types of models compared, with no clear winner across the board.

A fundamental pillar of reversible steganography is predictive modelling which can be realised via deep neural networks. However, non-trivial errors exist in inferences about some out-of-distribution and noisy data. In view of this issue, we propose to consider uncertainty in predictive models based upon a theoretical framework of Bayesian deep learning, thereby creating an adaptive steganographic system. Most modern deep-learning models are regarded as deterministic because they only offer predictions while failing to provide uncertainty measurement. Bayesian neural networks bring a probabilistic perspective to deep learning and can be regarded as self-aware intelligent machinery; that is, a machine that knows its own limitations. To quantify uncertainty, we apply Bayesian statistics to model the predictive distribution and approximate it through Monte Carlo sampling with stochastic forward passes. We further show that predictive uncertainty can be disentangled into aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties and these quantities can be learnt unsupervised.

Such studies are underpinned by specific movement models, which encode rules and assumptions about how people navigate a space and handle interactions with others. These models often give rise to macroscopic simulated crowd behaviours that are statistically valid, but which lack the noisy microscopic behaviours that are the signature of believable real crowds. In this article, we use an existing Turing test for crowds to identify realistic features of real crowds that are generally omitted from simulation models. Our previous study using this test established that untrained individuals have difficulty in classifying movies of crowds as real or simulated, and that such people often have an idealised view of how crowds move. In this follow-up study (with new participants) we perform a second trial, which now includes a training phase (showing participants movies of real crowds). We find that classification performance significantly improves after training, confirming the existence of features that allow participants to identify real crowds. High-performing individuals are able to identify the features of real crowds that should be incorporated into future simulations if they are to be considered realistic.", "venue": "Artificial Life", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 57, "citationCount": 1, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-01-01", "journal": {"volume": "28", "pages": "401-422", "name": "Artificial Life"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "144936973", "name": "M.

It is, we contend, perfectly possible that machine learning algorithms, which are unable to explain, and could even be unexplainable themselves, can still be of critical use in a process of explication. Thus, we report on an experiment with anthropological AI. From a dataset of 175K Facebook comments, we trained a neural network to predict the emoji reaction associated with a comment and asked a group of human players to compete against the machine. We show that a) the machine can reach the same (poor) accuracy as the players (51%), b) it fails in roughly the same ways as the players, and c) easily predictable emoji reactions tend to reflect unambiguous situations where interpretation is easy. We therefore repurpose the failures of the neural network to point us to deeper and more ambiguous situations where interpretation is hard and explication becomes both necessary and interesting.

Tay\u2019s repetition and production of hate speech calls for an approach that draws on both media and cultural theory\u2014the Frankfurt School\u2019s dialectical analyses of language and ideology, in particular. Revisiting the Frankfurt School in the age of algorithmic reason shows that, contrary to views foundational to computing, a neural-network chatbot like Tay does not sidestep meaning but rather carries and alters it, with unforeseen social and political consequences.

VAEs' latent-space structure and interpolation ability could effectively ground the interdisciplinary learning of AI, creative arts, and philosophy. Thus, we designed a lesson to teach high school students about VAEs. We developed a web-based game and used Plato's cave, a philosophical metaphor, to introduce how VAEs work. We used a Google Colab notebook for students to re-train VAEs with their hand-written digits to consolidate their understandings. Finally, we guided the exploration of creative VAE tools such as SketchRNN and MusicVAE to draw the connection between what they learned and real-world applications.

Students are good at understanding natural language questions and based on their domain knowledge can easily infer the question\u2019s answer by \u201cconnecting the dots\u201d across various pertinent facts. Considering automated reasoning for elementary science question answering, we address the novel task of generating explanations for answers from human-authored facts. For this, we examine the practically scalable framework of feature-rich support vector machines leveraging domain-targeted, hand-crafted features. Explanations are created from a human-annotated set of nearly 5000 candidate facts in the WorldTree corpus. Our aim is to obtain better matches for valid facts of an explanation for the correct answer of a question over the available fact candidates. To this end, our features offer a comprehensive linguistic and semantic unification paradigm. The machine learning problem is the preference ordering of facts, for which we test pointwise regression versus pairwise learning-to-rank. Our contributions, originating from comprehensive evaluations against nine existing systems, are (1) a case study in which two preference ordering approaches are systematically compared, and where the pointwise approach is shown to outperform the pairwise approach, thus adding to the existing survey of observations on this topic; (2) since our system outperforms a highly-effective TF-IDF-based IR technique by 3.5 and 4.9 points on the development and test sets, respectively, it demonstrates some of the further task improvement possibilities (e.g., in terms of an efficient learning algorithm, semantic features) on this task; (3) it is a practically competent approach that can outperform some variants of BERT-based reranking models; and (4) the human-engineered features make it an interpretable machine learning model for the task.", "venue": "Natural Language Engineering", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 41, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2021-10-18", "journal": {"volume": "abs/2110.09036", "name": "ArXiv"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1789682566", "name": "J.

Our review of existing IS literature reveals that suboptimal text mining techniques are prevalent and that the more advanced TLMs could be applied to enhance and increase IS research involving text data, and to enable new IS research topics, thus creating more value for the research community. This is possible because these techniques make it easier to develop very powerful custom systems and their performance is superior to existing methods for a wide range of tasks and applications.

The generation and availability of big\u2010data is a strong driving force for the development of AI/ML applications, however, several challenges need to be addressed, like processing speed, memory requirement, high bandwidth, low latency memory access, and highly conductive and flexible connections between processing units and memory blocks. The conventional computing platforms are unable to address these issues with machine learning and AI. Deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely employed for machine learning and AI applications, like speech recognition, computer vison, robotics, and so forth, efficiently and accurately. However, accuracy is achieved at the cost of high computational complexity, sacrificing energy efficiency and throughput like performance measuring parameters along with high latency. To address the problems of latency, energy efficiency, complexity, power consumption, and so forth, a lot of state of the art DNN accelerators have been designed and implemented in the form of application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). This work provides the state of the art of all these DNN accelerators which have been developed recently.

For this reason, they are sought to be an indispensable part of the future computing landscape. Neuromorphic systems are mainly used for spike-based machine learning applications, although there are some non-machine learning applications in graph theory, differential equations, and spike-based simulations. These applications suggest that neuromorphic computing might be capable of general-purpose computing. However, general-purpose computability of neuromorphic computing has not been established yet. In this work, we prove that neuromorphic computing is Turing-complete and therefore capable of general-purpose computing. Specifically, we present a model of neuromorphic computing, with just two neuron parameters (threshold and leak), and two synaptic parameters (weight and delay). We devise neuromorphic circuits for computing all the \u03bc-recursive functions (i.e., constant, successor and projection functions) and all the \u03bc-recursive operators (i.e., composition, primitive recursion and minimization operators).

Finding one's way involves finding possible uses of features of the world that might be beneficial or avoiding those that might be harmful. \"Possible uses of X to accomplish Y\" are \"Affordances\". The number of uses of X is indefinite (or unknown), the different uses are unordered and are not deducible from one another. All biological adaptations are either affordances seized by heritable variation and selection or, far faster, by the organism acting in its world finding uses of X to accomplish Y. Based on this, we reach rather astonishing conclusions: (1) Artificial General Intelligence based on Universal Turing Machines (UTMs) is not possible, since UTMs cannot \"find\" novel affordances. (2) Brain-mind is not purely classical physics for no classical physics system can be an analogue computer whose dynamical behavior can be isomorphic to \"possible uses\". (3) Brain mind must be partly quantum - supported by increasing evidence at 6.0 sigma to 7.3 Sigma. (4) Based on Heisenberg's interpretation of the quantum state as \"Potentia\" converted to \"Actuals\" by Measurement, a natural hypothesis is that mind actualizes Potentia. This is supported at 5.2 Sigma. Then Mind's actualizations of entangled brain-mind-world states are experienced as qualia and allow \"seeing\" or \"perceiving\" of uses of X to accomplish Y.

Arguably their most significant impact has been in the area of computer vision where great advances have been made in challenges such as plausible image generation, image-to-image translation, facial attribute manipulation, and similar domains. Despite the significant successes achieved to date, applying GANs to real-world problems still poses significant challenges, three of which we focus on here. These are as follows: (1) the generation of high quality images, (2) diversity of image generation, and (3) stabilizing training. Focusing on the degree to which popular GAN technologies have made progress against these challenges, we provide a detailed review of the state-of-the-art in GAN-related research in the published scientific literature. We further structure this review through a convenient taxonomy we have adopted based on variations in GAN architectures and loss functions. While several reviews for GANs have been presented to date, none have considered the status of this field based on their progress toward addressing practical challenges relevant to computer vision. Accordingly, we review and critically discuss the most popular architecture-variant, and loss-variant GANs, for tackling these challenges.

Pavlov, in a classic experiment, demonstrated how dogs can learn to associate a ringing bell with food, thereby causing a ring to result in salivation. Today, however, it is rare to find the use of Pavlovian type associative learning for artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Instead, other biologically-inspired learning concepts, in particular artificial neural networks (ANNs) have flourished, yielding extensive impact on a wide range of fields including finance, healthcare and transportation. However, learning in such \"conventional\" ANNs, in particular in the form of modern deep neural networks (DNNs) are usually carried out using the backpropagation method, is computationally and energy intensive. Here we report the experimental demonstration of backpropagation-free learning, achieved using a single (or monadic) associative hardware element. This is realized on an integrated photonic platform using phase change materials combined with on-chip cascaded directional couplers. We link associative learning with supervised learning, based on their common goal of associating certain inputs with \"correct\" outputs. We then expand the concept to develop larger-scale supervised learning networks using our monadic Pavlovian photonic hardware, developing a distinct machine-learning framework based on single-element associations and, importantly, using backpropagation-free single-layer weight architectures to approach general learning tasks. Our approach not only significantly reduces the computational burden imposed by learning in conventional neural network approaches, thereby increasing speed and decreasing energy use during learning, but also offers higher bandwidth inherent to a photonic implementation, paving the way for future deployment of fast photonic artificially intelligent machines.", "venue": "Optica", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 56, "citationCount": 1, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Physics", "Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Physics", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-11-30", "journal": {"volume": "abs/2011.14709", "name": "ArXiv"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2110399608", "name": "J.

Deep learning can predict the subtypes from genetic information more accurately than conventional statistical methods, but to date, deep learning has not been directly utilized to examine which genes are associated with which subtypes. To clarify the mechanisms embedded in the intrinsic subtypes, we developed an explainable deep learning model called a point-wise linear (PWL) model that generates a custom-made logistic regression for each patient. Logistic regression, which is familiar to both physicians and medical informatics researchers, allows us to analyze the importance of the feature variables, and the PWL model harnesses these practical abilities of logistic regression. In this study, we show that analyzing breast cancer subtypes is clinically beneficial for patients and one of the best ways to validate the capability of the PWL model. First, we trained the PWL model with RNA-seq data to predict PAM50 intrinsic subtypes and applied it to the 41/50 genes of PAM50 through the subtype prediction task. Second, we developed a deep enrichment analysis method to reveal the relationships between the PAM50 subtypes and the copy numbers of breast cancer. Our findings showed that the PWL model utilized genes relevant to the cell cycle-related pathways.

The purpose of the course was to study the intersection between Machine Intelligence and 6G telecommunication technology and outline possible future trends in this domain. Nowadays, not only researchers are enthusiastic about the topic of machine intelligence but also a widespread public. More and more longstanding problems in manifold areas such as natural language and computer vision become tractable, it is evident that machine intelligence as technology will play a crucial role in society, industry, and the environment in the foreseeable future. As we shall expect major changes, we asked ourselves the question: \u201dTo what extent do a higher data availability, larger data throughput, and an increased diversity of connected devices a\ufb00ect the future of machine intelligence?\u201d The students participating in the seminar tried to discuss exactly this question in the winter term 21/22. The students examined the status quo of machine learning methods in the context of 6G and give insights into \ufb01elds such as federated learning and generalization as well as their applications and the impact on the industry. Current trends are analyzed and projected into the future, which targets the question of how machine intelligence will be a\ufb00ected by the future of 6G. Abstract 6G and Machine Learning (ML) are two important pillars supporting the development of many technology trends in the industry. The exponentially growing number of devices will require 6G networks for more e\ufb03cient and reliable data exchanges. In addition, intelligent data processing, supported by machine learning, will provide new insights for improved industry practices. The industry of the future will be shaped by the integration of multiple technology trends. This report focuses on four industry trends that are expected to emerge or be enhanced by the combined use of 6G and ML: Edge Computing, Collaborative Robots, Digital Twins, and Augmented and Virtual Reality. We start the analysis with the key facts about each trend and then proceed to analyse each trend in terms of its key drivers, challenges and overall impact on the industry. Fi-nally, we compare these four trends and assess their relationship to each other. For this purpose, we use a driver matrix with the features\u2019 uncertainty and potential impact. Based on its maturity and its role in enabling and extending existing technologies, we concluded that Edge Computing will have the greatest impact and the least uncertainty in terms of its applicability in the industry. Abstract Since the world is becoming more connected, Internet users are subconsciously feeding the network with a tremendous amount of data. Meanwhile, many researchers and institutions are concerned and calling for more protection of sensitive data circulating in the network. For instance, the traditional centralized approach for training Arti\ufb01cial Intelligence (AI) models faces major challenges related to e\ufb03ciency and security. On one side modern communication industry is looking for way to process and distribute sensitive data across the network, on the other hand maintaining a high level of security and data streaming is also essential to achieve our goal. Lately, a new Machine Learning (ML) distributed approach is considered to be a promising solution to empower and integrate safely AI in 6G, which is Federated Learning (FL). FL is a distributed AI approach that provides data, solution functions, and training models in heterogeneous and large-scale networks. In this report, we start with some facts about e\ufb00ective communication in federated learning. Then, we give four trends as a vision of how FL will impact the future network with respect to sensitive data. We review some methods for ensuring fairness and addressing sources of bias. Next, we use the healthcare system as a source of sensitive data and see how it is represented in data-driven models. Finally, we see how the costs of Abstract What is Love? That question is still to be answered by R.E.M. Pun aside, humanity as a whole places an increasingly high hope into the bene\ufb01cial use of AI to solve arbitrary problems. This is largely promoted by the positive impact many people experience in their lives on a daily basis: smoke-detectors, image quality enhancement and chess training software may be some of the examples that might come to one\u2019s mind. Current-era communication technology on the other hand largely relies on conventional approaches. This trend report sets out to uncover the role Generalization could play to pave the way for AI in the emerging communication standard 6G. As we will show, Generalization might be looming closer on the horizon than expected, could have direct access and impact on end-users and should strive to improve equitable technology access for everyone\u2014and everything. Abstract The motivation of approaching futuristic networks that combine an extreme high reliability with a signi\ufb01cant connection density as well as an extreme high data rate or capacity has been pushing the research in the telecommunication \ufb01eld ever since it came to existence. This ever-awaited goal is getting closer to being in the realm of possibilities as 6th Generation wireless technology has been gaining momentum recently. As it seems, the aforementioned premise of the 6G technology is not only bene\ufb01cial as a powerful structure for networking, but rather, and arguably more important, as infrastructure for more sophisticated applications that require an e\ufb03cient network at their core. In this trend report, we present trends based on a review of state-of-art available documenta-tion of the topic \u201cApplications for 6G\u201d. Furthermore, we incorporate our own research and assessment to closely examine the facts, key drivers and challenges of each trend mentioned. Eventually, a conclusion is made to shed light on the comparison of these trends by analysing the uncertainty and impact of each.", "venue": "", "year": null, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": []}, {"paperId": "d4c822021a8cdab4ddf5482ce5a1cf6f1d66543c", "externalIds": {"DBLP": "journals/access/BellagardaA22", "DOI": "10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3173297", "CorpusId": 248684391}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d4c822021a8cdab4ddf5482ce5a1cf6f1d66543c", "title": "An Updated Survey on the Convergence of Distributed Ledger Technology and Artificial Intelligence: Current State, Major Challenges and Future Direction", "abstract": "In recent times, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) have become two of the most discussed sectors in Information Technology, with each having made a major impact.

Natural language is complex and similar statements can be expressed in various ways. Therefore, understanding natural language is an ongoing challenge in the \ufb01eld of Question Answering. To make the process from the question to the answer, the QA pipeline can be broken down to several sub-steps, as e.g. prediction of the potential type of the answer, entity linking and detection of references for properties relevant for the formal query.

The controversy that led to the Turing test", "abstract": "Turing\u2019s much debated test has turned 70 and is still fairly controversial. His 1950 paper is seen as a complex and multilayered text, and key questions about it remain largely unanswered. Why did Turing select learning from experience as the best approach to achieve machine intelligence? Why did he spend several years working with chess-playing as a task to illustrate and test for machine intelligence only to trade it out for conversational question-answering in 1950? Why did Turing refer to gender imitation in a test for machine intelligence? In this article, I shall address these questions by unveiling social, historical and epistemological roots of the so-called Turing test. I will draw attention to a historical fact that has been only scarcely observed in the secondary literature thus far, namely, that Turing's 1950 test emerged out of a controversy over the cognitive capabilities of digital computers, most notably out of debates with physicist and computer pioneer Douglas Hartree, chemist and philosopher Michael Polanyi, and neurosurgeon Geoffrey Jefferson. Seen in its historical context, Turing\u2019s 1950 paper can be understood as essentially a reply to a series of challenges posed to him by these thinkers arguing against his view that machines can think. Turing did propose gender learning and imitation as one of his various imitation tests for machine intelligence, and I argue here that this was done in response to Jefferson's suggestion that gendered behavior is causally related to the physiology of sex hormones.", "venue": "", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 54, "citationCount": 1, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Philosophy", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "145621246", "name": "Bernardo Gon\u00e7alves"}]}, {"paperId": "dbe4c5294a7334820f6b4524154bafd41d60c534", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 247570160}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dbe4c5294a7334820f6b4524154bafd41d60c534", "title": "VISUAL REASONING MODELS", "abstract": "How can we measure the reasoning capabilities of intelligence systems?

To answer this, we extend the visual question answering framework and propose the following behavioral test in the form of a two-player game. We consider black-box neural models of CLEVR. These models are trained on a diagnostic dataset benchmarking reasoning. Next, we train an adversarial player that re-configures the scene to fool the CLEVR model. We show that CLEVR models, which otherwise could perform at a \u201chuman level\u201d, can easily be fooled by our agent.

These questions are thoroughly examined using Turing\u2019s own texts and related sources. This study reconstructs Turing\u2019s historical context in postwar England and analyzes his irony and sense of humor, as well as the in\ufb02uence of Samuel Butler on his vision. Contrary to recent views in AI science and \ufb01ction, on the one hand, a mismatch is shown between Turing and the incautious Frankenstein; on the other hand, Turing\u2019s radical Shelley-like qualities are substantiated. The article shows that Turing\u2019s utopianism entrusted intelligent machines with the task of teaching lessons of rationality and intellectual integrity over our place in nature and prejudices.

At the same time, they function based on implicit understandings of \u201clearning,\u201d \u201cmanagement,\u201d and \u201csystems\u201d that privilege some knowledges, interactions, and discourses while de-emphasizing others.

Originality/value: This work seeks to fill a gap arising from the scarcity of meta-analytic research on service delivery with AI and also its relationship to consumer satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopted the meta-analytic method, and its development followed three phases: 1. research; 2. collection; and 3. coding and data analysis. We analyzed 19 articles published in journals of international relevance from January 2000 to December 2020, present on the Web of Science and Science Direct platforms, totaling 128 observations and 28 topic-related. Findings: Five background constructs and one consequent construct were identified, from which an integrated model was built to illustrate the relationships between consumer satisfaction in intelligent services. The results show that consumer satisfaction in the provision of services is significantly correlated to the adoption of artificial intelligence. Then, the integrated quantitative evaluation that was performed in this study aims to contribute to future empirical evidence in such a way that an increase in the scope of studies on artificial intelligence and consumer satisfaction occurs, based on the analysis of the following constructs: perceived value, perceived features, perception of quality, marketing orientation, identification with the service and behavior of using AI in services.", "venue": "RAM.

(English)", "abstract": "Summary: An important lesson that philosophy can learn from the Turing test and computer science more generally concerns the careful use of the method of levels of abstraction (LoAs). The purpose of this paper is to summarize the method and apply it to the paper, modelling and analysis of phenomenological and conceptual systems showing its principal features and main advantages. The constituents of the method are \u201cobservables\u201d, collected together and moderated by predicates restrain-ing their \u201cbehaviour\u201d. The resulting collection of sets of observables is called a \u201cgradient of abstractions\u201d (GoAs) and it formalises the minimum consistency conditions that the chosen abstractions must satisfy. Two useful kinds of GoA \u2013 disjoint and nested \u2013 are identi\ufb01ed. It is then argued that in any discrete (as distinct from analogue) domain of discourse, a complex phenomenon may be explicated in terms of simple approximations organised together in a GoAs. Thus, the method replaces, for discrete disciplines, the dif-ferential and integral calculus, which form the basis for understanding the complex analogue phenomena of science and engineering. The result formalises an approach that is rather common in computer science but has hitherto found little application in philosophy. So the philosophical value of the method is demonstrated by showing how making the LoA of discourse explicit can be fruitful for phenomenological and conceptual analysis. To this end, the method is applied to the Turing test, the concept of agenthood, the de\ufb01nition of emergence, the notion of arti\ufb01cial life, quantum observation and decidable observation. This paper applies the method of abstraction to the paper, modelling and analysis of phenomenological and conceptual systems showing its principal features and main advantages. It is hoped that this treatment will promote the use of the method in certain areas of the humanities and especially in philosophy.", "venue": "", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 23, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Philosophy", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": []}, {"paperId": "d0707c3d6f715f16f8d7fbafb73a2057fa031841", "externalIds": {"DBLP": "conf/ircdl/Lana22", "CorpusId": 251020054}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d0707c3d6f715f16f8d7fbafb73a2057fa031841", "title": "Artificial Intelligence Systems Producing Books: Questions of Agency", "abstract": "The publication of the book Beta Writer. 2019.

We lay out three concerns arising from such a scenario and evaluate recent predictions and objections to these concerns. Then we analyze how a utilitarian social planner would allocate work and income if these concerns start to materialize. As the income produced by autonomous machines rises and the value of labor declines, a utilitarian planner finds it optimal to phase out work, beginning with workers who have low labor productivity and job satisfaction, since they have comparative advantage in enjoying leisure. This is in stark contrast to welfare systems that force individuals with low labor productivity to work. If there are significant wage declines, avoiding mass misery will require other ways of distributing income than labor markets, whether via sufficiently well-distributed capital ownership or via benefits. Recipients could still engage in work for its own sake if they enjoy work amenities such as structure, purpose and meaning. If work gives rise to positive externalities such as social connections or political stability, or if individuals undervalue the benefits of work because of internalities, then a social planner would incentivize work.

The first step of noun phrase extraction is aimed at reducing the set of terms to those that best describe what the web pages are about to improve the categorization capabilities of the model. Separately, a text preprocessing using keyword extraction is evaluated. In addition to the text preprocessing techniques mentioned, feature reduction techniques are applied to optimize model performance. Several modeling techniques are examined using these two approaches and are compared to a baseline model. The baseline model is a Support Vector Machine with linear kernel and is based on text preprocessing and feature reduction techniques that do not include noun phrase extraction or keyword extraction and uses stemming rather than lemmatization.

However, this technology has raised security threats that are different from existing ones. Recent studies have shown that artificial neural networks can easily malfunction by adversarial examples. The adversarial examples operate the neural network model as intended by the adversary. In particular, adversarial examples targeting speech recognition models is an area that has been actively studied in recent years. Existing studies have focused more on white-box methods. However, most speech recognition services are provided online and involve black-box, making it difficult or impossible for adversaries to attack. Black-box attacks have several challenges. Typically, they have a low success rate and a high risk of detection. In particular, previously proposed genetic algorithm (GA)-based attacks are at a high risk of detection because they require numerous queries. Therefore, we propose an adversarial attack system using particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms to address these problems. The proposed system uses adversarial candidates as particles to obtain adversarial examples through iterative optimization. PSO-based adversarial attacks are more efficient in queries and have a higher attack success rate than the adversarial methods using GAs. In particular, our key function is that temporary particle generation maximizes query efficiency to reduce detection risk and prevent wastage of system resources. On average, our system exhibits 96% attack success rates with 1416.17 queries, indicating that is 71.41% and 8% better in terms of query and success rates than existing GA-based attacks, respectively.", "venue": "IEEE Access", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 50, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"volume": "10", "pages": "23532-23544", "name": "IEEE Access"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "98436176", "name": "H.

To clarify the boundaries of \u201copenness\u201d, we conduct two studies: First, we classify the types of \u201cspeech events\u201d encountered in a chatbot evaluation data set (i.e., Meena by Google) and find that these conversations mainly cover the \u201csmall talk\u201d category and exclude the other speech event categories encountered in real life human-human communication.

In this project, we have implemented a chatbot that recommends music based on the user's text tone. By analyzing the tone of the text expressed by the user, we can identify the mood. Once the mood is identified, the application will play songs in the form of a web page based on the user's choice as well as his current mood. In our proposed system, themain goal is to reliably determine a user's mood based on their text tone with an application that can be installed on the user's desktop. In today's world, human computer interaction (HCI) plays a crucial role, and the most popular concept in HCI is recognition of emotion from text. As part of this process, the frontal view of the user's text is used to determine the mood. The extraction of text tone from the user's text is anotherimportant aspect. We have used IBM Analyser to check the text tone of the user and to predict the mood based on the text of the user, and Last.FM API to recommend songs based on themood of the user.

Non-invasive liver imaging technologies such ultrasound (US) is the preferable method for screening hepatic steatosis because to its non-invasiveness, cheap cost, and widespread availability.\nArtificial intelligence (AI), in particular deep learning algorithms, has garnered widespread notice for its superior performance on image identification and quantification. They are capable of quantitatively assessing complicated medical image properties automatically and achieving better diagnostic accuracy while increasing efficiency. AI is frequently utilized and gaining popularity in the field of liver medical imaging, which includes radiology, nuclear medicine and ultrasound. AI can assist physicians in making more accurate and reproducible imaging diagnoses while also reducing the workload of physicians.\n \n \n OBJECTIVE\n The primary purpose of this work was to conduct a scoping review of artificial intelligence technologies for hepatic steatosis detection and quantification. It also aimed to explore the role of AI technologies on Ultrasonography for the detection and quantification of hepatic steatosis.\n \n \n METHODS\n The researcher searched several electronic bibliographies including Google Scholar, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsychINFO, ACM Digital, IEEEXplore, and Scopus. The references retrieved were investigated for additional relevant studies through the backward and forward reference list checking strategy. One reviewer carried out the studies selection and data extraction.\n \n \n RESULTS\n A total of 718 publications were retrieved; 268 duplicates were removed. After scanning the titles and abstracts, 234 were excluded. After scanning the full texts, many articles were excluded for the following reasons: studies focusing on diseases other than liver parenchymal diseases (n = 39), studies that did not confirm the specified outcomes or confirmation study population (n = 58), studies that were not original research, i.e., reviews, editorials (n = 106), and studies not written in English (n = 8). The qualitative analysis comprised a total of 25 publications.\n \n \n CONCLUSIONS\n This review illustrates the potential for AI systems to aid in the diagnosis and stage of liver fibrosis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. By incorporating AI into established noninvasive methods, effective diagnostic tools with an ideal mix of sensitivity and specificity are created. Before adopting these AI-assisted systems in clinical practice, it is necessary to validate these models in additional independent cohorts.\n", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 53, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2021-12-23", "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "51139216", "name": "Fahad Alshagathrh"}]}, {"paperId": "ab600896f6657d00852d4a21e2d375e28c38224f", "externalIds": {"DBLP": "journals/ais/Tzouganatou22", "DOI": "10.1007/s00146-021-01361-3", "CorpusId": 245467431}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ab600896f6657d00852d4a21e2d375e28c38224f", "title": "Openness and privacy in born-digital archives: reflecting the role of AI development", "abstract": null, "venue": "Ai & Society", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 45, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Art", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-12-23", "journal": {"volume": "37", "pages": "991 - 999", "name": "AI & SOCIETY"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "117313976", "name": "A.

Our contribution is a system for assessing the believability of computer players. The state of the art examines existing methods and identifies seven distinguishing features that differ considerably from one assessment to the next. Our investigation reveals that assessment procedures typically alter gameplay, posing a considerable danger of bias. This is a major flaw since computer players are evaluated in a specific context rather than in the context of the game as it should be played, potentially skewing the findings of the evaluation. As a result, we begin on a trial-and-error process, with each new proposal building on the achievements of the previous one while removing the flaws. New proposals are tested with new assessments, a total of three experiments are then presented. We created a computer program that partially automates the execution of the assessment procedure, making these trials easier to implement. At the end, thanks to our proposal, gamers can assess the believability of computer players indirectly by employing reporting forms that alert users to the presence of bots. We assume that the more a bot is reported, the less credible it becomes. We ran a final experiment to test our proposal, which yielded extremely encouraging results.", "venue": "Frontiers in Computer Science", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 57, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-12-23", "journal": {"volume": "3"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "31571192", "name": "Cindy Even"}, {"authorId": "1962736", "name": "Anne-Gwenn Bosser"}, {"authorId": "1753287", "name": "C\u00e9dric Buche"}]}, {"paperId": "deafac3f3a4b8c83735ff9bd219224ebc9b1ec6a", "externalIds": {"DBLP": "series/synthesis/2021Shanthamallu", "DOI": "10.2200/s01135ed1v01y202109spr022", "CorpusId": 245428047}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/deafac3f3a4b8c83735ff9bd219224ebc9b1ec6a", "title": "Machine and Deep Learning Algorithms and Applications", "abstract": null, "venue": "Synthesis Lectures on Signal Processing", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 78, "citationCount": 4, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-12-22", "journal": {"pages": "1-123"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "40692862", "name": "U.

These structures have statistically significant correlations with sensory stimuli and reinforcement contingencies perceived by the subject. The repeated collapse of self-organized structures at theta/alpha rates generates laterally propagating phase gradients (phase cones), ignited at some specific location of the cortical sheet. Phase cones have been interpreted as neural signatures of transient perceptual experiences according to the cinematic theory of brain dynamics. The rapid expansion of essentially isotropic phase cones is consistent with the propagation of perceptual broadcasts postulated by Global Workspace Theory (GWT). What is the evolutionary advantage of brains operating with repeatedly collapsing dynamics? This question is answered using thermodynamic concepts. According to neuropercolation theory, waking brains are described as non-equilibrium thermodynamic systems operating at the edge of criticality, undergoing repeated phase transitions. This work analyzes the role of long-range axonal connections and metabolic processes in the regulation of critical brain dynamics. Historically, the near 10 Hz domain has been associated with conscious sensory integration, cortical \u201cignitions\u201d linked to conscious visual perception, and conscious experiences. We can therefore combine a very large body of experimental evidence and theory, including graph theory, neuropercolation, and GWT.

People often need quick informational help, like health/legal advice, shopping/cooking tips, insider opinion, etc. The needs are important and ubiquitous, and most could be satisfied via quick chats with others, who may or may not be experts. In fact, knowledge common to some is often sought by others; every human, expert or non-expert, young or old, has helpful values. Yet, the reality is that people usually cannot find helpers easily, end up spending much more time and money, or even get no answer at all. This signifies a critical issue: the current labour market, called by this paper the Conventional Market (CM), massively fails such Burst Jobs, leading to huge job opportunity losses and human intelligence underutilization. This paper attributes the failure to high transaction costs due to technology constraints. Thus, this paper proposes creating an online Burst Market (BM) letting people sell any services at their own price via video or audio chats lasting as short as a few seconds or minutes. The solution is feasible and lucrative thanks to technology progress. It will empower all people, including not only professionals but also the vast ordinary individuals, and create enormous part-time and full-time jobs. As a result, it will aid in poverty lifting and alleviate aging society problem as people will be able to earn income more easily, reduce AI-led unemployment through the highly intelligent BM jobs, maximize human values through the easy acquisition and sale of skills with Life-Long Working, and increase prosperity and human achievements thanks to the collaboration breakthrough. The BM will also reshape industries, and may cause a global power reshuffle or even the ultimate destruction of nations.

This article explores two possibilities. Firstly, whether transfer learning can aid in the improvement of customer service chatbots between business domains. Second, the implementation of a framework for physical robots for in-person interaction. Modelled on social interaction with Twitter customer support accounts, transformer-based chatbot models are initially assigned to learn one domain from an initial random weight distribution. Given shared vocabulary, each model is then tasked with learning another domain by transferring knowledge from the previous. Following studies on 19 different businesses, results show that the majority of models are improved when transferring weights from at least one other domain, in particular those that are more data-scarce than others. General language transfer learning occurs, as well as higher-level transfer of similar domain knowledge, in several cases.

The implementation science community is made of individuals on a continuum between academia and practice, but it is unclear to what extent the theoretical deliberations of implementation academics are translated into the work of implementation practitioners and on to patient benefit. This bibliometric study aims to use the field of clinical artificial intelligence(AI) implementation to sample the prevalence and character of theoretically informed implementation practices.\nMethods\n\nQualitative research of key stakeholder perspectives on clinical AI published between 2014-2021 was systematically identified. Following title, abstract and full-text screening eligible articles were characterised in terms of their publication, AI tool and context studied, the theoretical approach if any and the research methods and quality. Descriptive, comparative and regression statistics were applied.\nResults\n\nOne-hundred-and-eleven studies met the eligibility criteria, with monthly eligible publication rate increasing from 0.7-4.0 between 2014-2021. Eligible studies represented 23 different nations and 25 different clinical specialities. A theoretical approach was explicitly employed in 39(35.1%) studies though 6 of these described novel theoretical approaches(15.1%) and the most frequently used theoretical approach was only used 3 times. There was no statistically significant trend in the prevalence of theoretically informed research within the study period. Of the 25 theoretically informed studies conducted in Europe or North America 19(76%) used theories that originated in the same continent.\nConclusions\n\nThe theoretical approaches which characterise implementation science are not being put to use as often as they could, and the means by which they are selected also seems suboptimal. The field may facilitate a greater synergy between theory and practice if the focus shifts from unifying implementation theories on to unifying and expanding the implementation community. By making more theoretical approaches accessible to practitioners and supporting their selection and application, theory could be more effectively harnessed to close healthcare\u2019s \u2018know-do gaps\u2019.\nProtocol registration\n PROSPERO ID 248025", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 54, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-11-22", "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "32243895", "name": "H.

This paper describes a prototype NLU system for Thai language based on Mental Image Directed Semantic Theory in order to help Thai language beginners more comprehensively. For the first step, Thai sentences of basic structures intended for amateur users were chosen for the system to process. In the system, input sentences are fragmented to detect constituent words and their grammatical relationships, and then transduced to semantic representations in a formal language named Language for Mental-image Description. The semantic interpretations are evaluated through reasoning processes such as disambiguation and entailment.

While it is doubtful that one can identify any fully autonomous machine system at this point in time, especially one that is openly and publicly acknowledged to be so, it is far less debatable that our present line of technological evolution is leading toward this eventuality (Endsley, 2017; Hancock, 2017a). It is this specter of the consequences of even existentially threatening adverse events, emanating from these penetrative autonomous systems, which is the focus of the present work. The impending and imperative question is what we intend to do about these prospective challenges? As with essentially all of human discourse, we can imagine two sides to this question.

The opposing vision promulgates a dystopian nightmare in which machines have gained almost total ascendency and only a few \u201cplucky\u201d humans remain. The latter is most especially a featured trope of the human heroic narrative (Campbell, 1949). It will be most probably the case that neither of the extremes on this putative spectrum of possibilities will represent the eventual reality that we will actually experience. However, the ground rules are now in the process of being set which will predispose us toward one of these directions over the other (Feng et al., 2016; Hancock, 2017a). Traditionally, many have approached this general form of technological inquiry by asking questions about strengths, weaknesses, threats, and opportunities. Consequently, it is within this general framework that this present work is offered. What follows are some overall considerations of the balance of the value of such autonomous systems\u2019 inauguration and penetration. These observations provide the bedrock from which to consider the specific strengths, weaknesses, threats (risks), and promises (opportunity) dimensions. The specific consideration of the application of the protective strategies of the well-known hierarchy of controls (Haddon, 1973) then acts as a final prefatory consideration to the concluding discussion which examines the adverse actions of autonomous technological systems as a potential human existential threat. The term autonomy is one that has been, and still currently is, the subject of much attention, debate, and even abuse (and see Ezenkwu & Starkey, 2019). To an extent, the term seems to be flexible enough to encompass almost whatever the proximal user requires of it. For example, a simple, descriptive word-cloud (Figure 1), illustrates the various terminologies that surrounds our present use of this focal term. It is not the present purpose here to engage in a long, polemic and potentially unedifying dispute specifically about the term\u2019s definition. This is because the present concern is with autonomous technological systems, and not about the greater meaning of autonomy per se, either as a property or as a process. The definition which is adopted here is that: \u201cautonomous systems are generative and learn, evolve, and permanently change their functional capacities as a result of the input of operational and contextual information. Their actions necessarily become more", "venue": "Hum. Comput.

In certain cases, the ambiguity gives rise to humor, which can serve to illustrate the mistake itself. We conducted an online experiment with 400 native English speakers to explore the use of a chatbot to harness such humor. In an interaction resembling an advanced grammar exercise, the chatbot presented participants with a phrase containing a misplaced modifier, explained the ambiguity in the phrase, acknowledged (or ignored) the humor that the ambiguity gave rise to, and suggested a correction. Participants then completed a questionnaire, rating the chatbot with respect to ten traits.

At its core, it is a definition, whose task is to define in precise terms what it means to be \u201ccomputable\u201d. But it is not called a \u201cdefinition\u201d because it is much more than just a definition, begging to be falsified by a counterexample, much like a conjecture. It could be argued that the Church-Turing thesis is a challenge set forth to redefine computation should anything noteworthy be discovered. But nothing was. In almost a century now, many new models of computation have arisen, and all were eventually proven to be equivalent to the Turing machine. Although there were many more or less simplistic attempts to relate Turing machines to minds, we will argue that the simpler arguments along those lines do little to clarify the concept of mind. As for more complex arguments, they cannot be provided right away, for a rough framework along the lines of Ashby-style cybernetics [Ashby, 1956] is to be acquired in order to put forth any sensical, i.e. non-dualist, comparison between minds and machines. Once this is done, the notions of computational complexity, and its generalization \u2013 metaphysical complexity \u2013 can be rediscovered in the mind, and, surprisingly, in society. Even though computation-in-society is traditionally viewed as a strong cybernetic moment, it is not that unique to cybernetics and has become commonplace in mainstream AI as well (cf.

This requirement, in particular, to the mathematical tools used to solve problems of cognition, it revealed paradoxes in the foundations of mathematics, which are discussed in the article. \nAt present, in the natural and applied sciences in most publications, i.e. more than 90% associated with the construction of formal theories in these sciences, the proof of theorems is carried out: \nfirstly, in a meaningful way, which contradicts the urgent requirement of philosophers of science to use exclusively formal evidence, which is a criterion for assessing the correctness and reliability of evidence; \nsecondly, in substantive evidence in 95% of cases, an exclusively standard list of tautologies is used, which by definition is incorrect for the purpose of proving theorems on phenomena and processes of the universe based on exclusively true axioms obtained as a result of full-scale experimentation with these phenomena and processes. The article deals with the paradox in the classical approach to proving theorems, which consists in the inappropriateness of generally accepted stereotypical tautologies of classical mathematics for proving theorems.", "venue": "Transfer of Innovative Technologies", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 35, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Philosophy", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-10-29", "journal": {"name": "Transfer of Innovative Technologies"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "79815445", "name": "V.

Contributory experts have practical expertise\u2014they can \u201cwalk the walk.\u201d Interactional experts have internalized the tacit components of expertise\u2014they can \u201ctalk the talk\u201d but are not able to reliably \u201cwalk the walk.\u201d Interactional expertise permits effective communication between contributory experts and others (e.g., laypeople), which in turn facilitates working jointly toward shared goals. Interactional expertise is attained through long-term immersion into the expert community in question. To assess interactional expertise, researchers developed the imitation game\u2014a variant of the Turing test\u2014to test whether a person, or a particular group, possesses interactional expertise of another. The imitation game, which has been used mainly in sociology to study the social nature of knowledge, may also be a useful tool for researchers who focus on cognitive aspects of expertise. In this paper, we introduce a modified version of the imitation game and apply it to examine interactional expertise in the context of blindness. Specifically, we examined blind and sighted individuals\u2019 ability to imitate each other in a street-crossing scenario. In Phase I, blind and sighted individuals provided verbal reports of their thought processes associated with crossing a street\u2014once while imitating the other group (i.e., as a pretender) and once responding genuinely (i.e., as a non-pretender). In Phase II, transcriptions of the reports were judged as either genuine or imitated responses by a different set of blind and sighted participants, who also provided the reasoning for their decisions. The judges comprised blind individuals, sighted orientation-and-mobility specialists, and sighted individuals with infrequent socialization with blind individuals. Decision data were analyzed using probit mixed models for signal-detection-theory indices. Reasoning data were analyzed using natural-language-processing (NLP) techniques. The results revealed evidence that interactional expertise (i.e., relevant tacit knowledge) can be acquired by immersion in the group that possesses and produces the expert knowledge. The modified imitation game can be a useful research tool for measuring interactional expertise within a community of practice and evaluating practitioners\u2019 understanding of true experts.", "venue": "Frontiers in Psychology", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 46, "citationCount": 1, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-10-29", "journal": {"volume": "12", "name": "Frontiers in Psychology"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3219950", "name": "Guler Arsal"}, {"authorId": "3153660", "name": "J.

Similar to human toddlers, well-timed guidance and multimodal interactions might significantly enhance the training efficiency of AI agents as well. To validate this hypothesis, we adapt this notion of critical periods to learning in AI agents and investigate the critical period in the virtual environment for AI agents. We formalize the critical period and Toddler-guidance learning in the reinforcement learning (RL) framework. Then, we built up a toddler-like environment with VECA toolkit to mimic human toddlers\u2019 learning characteristics. We study three discrete levels of mutual interaction: weak-mentor guidance (sparse reward), moderate mentor guidance (helper-reward), and mentor demonstration (behavioral cloning). We also introduce the EAVE dataset consisting of 30,000 real-world images to fully reflect the toddler\u2019s viewpoint. We evaluate the impact of critical periods on AI agents from two perspectives: how and when they are guided best in both uni- and multimodal learning. Our experimental results show that both uni- and multimodal agents with moderate mentor guidance and critical period on 1 million and 2 million training steps show a noticeable improvement. We validate these results with transfer learning on the EAVE dataset and find the performance advancement on the same critical period and the guidance.", "venue": "ICMI", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 56, "citationCount": 1, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book"], "publicationDate": "2021-10-18", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 2021 International Conference on Multimodal Interaction"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2109220128", "name": "Junseok Park"}, {"authorId": "73758722", "name": "Kwanyoung Park"}, {"authorId": "2087142998", "name": "Hyunseok Oh"}, {"authorId": "2110880154", "name": "Ganghun Lee"}, {"authorId": "2152165744", "name": "M.

Many industries have tried the current suite of ML and AI algorithms with various degrees of success. Mineral processing, as an industry, is looking at AI for two reasons. First of all, as with other industries, it is pertinent to know if AI algorithms can be used to enhance productivity. The second reason is specific to the mining industry. Of late, the grade of ores is reducing, and the demand for ethical mining (with as little effect on ecology as possible) is increasing. Thus, mineral processing industries also want to explore the possible use of AI in solving these challenges. In this review paper, first, the challenges in mineral processing that can potentially be solved by AI are presented. Then, some of the most pertinent developments in the domain of ML and AI (applied in the domain of mineral processing) are discussed. Lastly, a top-level modus operandi is presented for a mineral processing industry that might want to explore the possibilities of using AI in its processes. Following are some of the new paradigms added by this review. This review presents a holistic view of the domain of mineral processing with an AI lens. It is also one of the first reviews in this domain to thoroughly discuss the use of AI in ethical, green, and sustainable mineral processing. The AI process proposed in this paper is a comprehensive one. To ensure the relevance to industry, the flow was made agile with the spiral system engineering flow. This is expected to drive rapid and agile investigation of the potential of applying ML and AI in different mineral processing industries.", "venue": "Minerals", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 170, "citationCount": 1, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2021-10-12", "journal": {"name": "Minerals"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1823937061", "name": "A.

However, to develop a machine that thinks like a human brain is still a dream for researchers. Aristotle\u2019s early efforts to devise logical thinking via his syllogisms (a three-part deductive reasoning) were a source of inspiration for modern computers and technologies1. In the1950, Alan Turing designed a machine to decode encrypted messages, which was a breakthrough of super computers in the days of yore. He designed the \u201cTuring Test\u201d which was coined to assess whether a computer could exhibit intelligence better known as \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d (AI) today2. AI is \u201ca field of science and engineering concerned with the computational understanding of what is commonly called intelligent behavior, and with the creation of artifacts that exhibit such behaviour\u201d3. \nSince 1980, AI has come a long way, virtual reality is being used in dental education these days to create real life situations and promote clinical work on simulators to eliminate risk factors associated with training on live patients. Recently artificial intelligence has been integrated with tutoring systems like \u201cUnified Medical Language System\u201d (UMLS), which have resulted in a better quality of feedback, which the preclinical virtual patients provide to the students4,5. This interactive phase helps students to evaluate their clinical skills and compare their skills with the standard ones, thus creating an ideal and high-quality training environment. Studies have been carried out regarding the efficacy of AI systems, which have stipulated that preclinical students build higher competencies than with the use of traditional simulator units6-8. \nCurrently AI inbuilt virtual dental assistants are present in the market. They can execute various chair side tasks with greater accuracy and less manpower ensuring minimum error during the procedures. In the world of implantology and maxillofacial surgery AI helps plan and prepare surgeries with smallest details forgoing actual surgery. Some exceptional uses of AI include robotic surgeries in the field of maxillofacial surgery and bioprinting (where tissues and organs can be reconstructed in thin layers)9. The field of AI has flourished to great extent in the past decade; AI systems are an aid to the field of dentistry and dental education.\u00a0 \nThis narrative attempts to explain possible AI-based applications in the future, it can be used for dental diagnosis, planning out treatments, conducting image analysis, and record keeping. AI-based technologies streamline and reduce laborious workforce to routine tasks, it ensures dental procedures are possible at a lower cost and ultimately makes predictive, preventive, and participatory dentistry possible.\u00a0The use of AI in dental procedures needs to be guaranteed; its application with human oversight and evidence-based dentistry shall be expected.

The heterogeneity of porous solids at the micro-level is considered in various material properties and geometrical attributes. For material properties, elastic constants, which are Lame\u2019s coefficients, are subjected to be heterogeneous in the linear elastic responses. For geometrical features, different numbers, sizes, and locations of voids are considered to reflect the heterogeneity of porous solids. A database for homogenized microstructural responses is constructed from a series of micro-level FE simulations, and machine learning is used to train and test our proposed model. In particular, four geometrical descriptors are designed, based on N-probability and lineal-path functions, to clearly reflect the geometrical heterogeneity of various microstructures.

Such practice, in turn, has provoked harsh criticism that usually refers back to the literal meaning of the words to show their inappropriateness in describing artificial agents.

However, it is well established that the current DL methodology produces universally unstable neural networks (NNs). The instability problem has caused an enormous research effort \u2013 with a vast literature on so-called adversarial attacks \u2013 yet there has been no solution to the problem. Our paper addresses why there has been no solution to the problem, as we prove the following mathematical paradox: any training procedure based on training neural networks for classification problems with a fixed architecture will yield neural networks that are either inaccurate or unstable (if accurate) \u2013 despite the provable existence of both accurate and stable neural networks for the same classification problems. The key is that the stable and accurate neural networks must have variable dimensions depending on the input, in particular, variable dimensions is a necessary condition for stability. Our result points towards the paradox that accurate and stable neural networks exist, however, modern algorithms do not compute them. This yields the question: if the existence of neural networks with desirable properties can be proven, can one also find algorithms that compute them? There are cases in mathematics where provable existence implies computability, but will this be the case for neural networks? The contrary is true, as we demonstrate how neural networks can provably exist as approximate minimisers to standard optimisation problems with standard cost functions, however, no randomised algorithm can compute them with probability better than 1/2.

Features of AI systems embody implicit beliefs concerning the human nature that AI developers have. \u201cStrong\u201d AI, which has the general cognitive abilities of an adult, has not yet been created, while \u201cweak\u201d AI is already part of the planetary computation infrastructure. Neural network AI mimics specific types of human behavior, generalizing data about the everyday lives of its users. This AI approach corresponds to the philosophical mainstream of the 20th century, when everyday life was seen as a source of the linguistic and the social pre-given that yields mutual understanding. This approach is also based on the traditional human-machine dichotomy and the corresponding idea that human nature is stable and independent of the technological condition. However, in the post-metaphysical age, when human interaction with technology is communicative rather than instrumental, data on everyday life cannot be an independent paragon of the human nature. AI systems do not only codify the descriptive features of human nature, but also discipline their users, as the digital environment in which everyday data can be collected is already organized by AI. Accordingly, in the digital environment, people are forced to reproduce new norms of behavior, codified by AI, which became one of the forms of human self-mastery, or anthropotechnology. The impact of AI is rarely noted, as the digital environment in which people interact with AI is not organized in a way that is clearly understandable. The anthropotechnological nature of AI is a side effect of the development of platforms, so AI developers rarely take responsibility for the norms embodied in the systems they create.", "venue": "Filosofska dumka (Philosophical Thought)", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 19, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-09-07", "journal": {"name": "Filosofska dumka (Philosophical Thought)"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2135028481", "name": "Mykhailo Bogachov"}]}, {"paperId": "ea7d7c7486896c5399981f1ab5a2c45af2a8b538", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3198531868", "DOI": "10.1007/S43681-021-00092-X", "CorpusId": 239681870}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ea7d7c7486896c5399981f1ab5a2c45af2a8b538", "title": "Robotomorphy: Becoming our creations", "abstract": null, "venue": "", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 54, "citationCount": 5, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-09-04", "journal": {"volume": "", "name": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "119177143", "name": "H.

To be specific, it requires the motion of robots not only to be physically collision-free but also to consider and respect the social conventions developed and enforced in the human social contexts. Among these social conventions, personal space, or proxemics, is one of the most commonly considered in the robot behavioral design. Nevertheless, most previous research efforts assumed that robots could generate human-like motions by merely mimicking a human. Rarely are the robot\u2019s behavioral algorithms assessed and verified by human participants. Therefore, to fill the research gap, a Turing-like simulation test, which contains the interaction of two agents (each agent could be a human or a robot) in a shared space was conducted. Participants (33 in total) were asked to identify and label the category of those agents followed by questionnaires. Results revealed that people who had different attitudes and prior expectations of appropriate robot behaviors responded to the algorithm differently, and their identification accuracy varied significantly.

Most researchers focus on the substantive scope of AI regulation, including state law, ethical norms and soft law. In addition to the substantive and legal scope of the regulation, it is worthwhile considering the manner of such regulation.1 Since AI is an algorithmic code, it seems correct to regulate (restrict) AI not so much with traditional law established in natural (human) language as with one implemented into algorithms. They may operate as a tool supporting traditional legislation (RegTech), but it is possible to go further with the issue and create regulation algorithms which implement the law as the effective law.

The proficiency of artificial intelligence techniques has been explored to a great extent in the field of medicine. Most of the medications go to the business sector after a long tedious process of drug development. It can take a period of 10-15 years or more to convey a medication from its introductory revelation to the hands of the patients. Artificial Intelligence can significantly reduce the time required and can also cut down the expenses by half. Among the methods, artificial neural network is the most widely used analytical tool while other techniques like fuzzy expert systems, natural language processing, robotic process automation and evolutionary computation have been used in different clinical settings. The aim of this paper is to discuss the different artificial intelligence techniques and provide a perspective on the benefits, future opportunities and risks of established artificial intelligence applications in clinical practice on medical education, physicians, healthcare institutions and bioethics.

Therefore, a meta-evaluation system is necessary for designers to test the effectiveness of OEs. In this paper, we present Armor, a complex and cross-domain benchmark dataset that serves this purpose. Since OEs should correlate with human judgment, we provide music as test cases for OEs and human judgment scores as touchstones. We also provide two meta-evaluation scenarios and their corresponding testing methods to assess the effectiveness of OEs. To the best of our knowledge, Armor is the first comprehensive and rigorous framework that future works could follow, take example by, and improve upon for the task of evaluating computer-generated music and the field of computational music as a whole.

This technological integration will ultimately imply a need to transform traditional business models.

Cognitive approaches that simulate both human behavior and thinking are leading to advanced analytical models that help companies to boost sales and customer engagement, improve their operational efficiency, improve their services and, in short, generate new relevant information from data. These decision-making models are based on descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analytics. This necessitates the existence of a legal framework that regulates all digital changes with uniformity between countries and helps a proper digital transformation process under a clear regulation. On the other hand, it is essential that this digital disruption is not slowed down by the regulatory framework.

Despite the integration of state-of-the-art computational technologies in different design phases, this integration happens within a limited scope, focusing mainly on tangible aspects of the design process, such as technical systems and visual representations. This lets architectural design miss the wider scope technology provides, where it can help in developing the computational design process through incorporating new intangible knowledge domains that were usually neglected, such as tacit knowledge, and through incorporating more design entities that were not included in the design process before.Design/methodology/approachThe study conducts an interdisciplinary analytical review of the literature to achieve two main research goals. The first goal investigates TK communication between human beings and the second understands approaches of TK communication between humans and computers. For each goal, three phases were implemented; an initial research phase, where main keywords are identified, a sampling and selection of literature phase and an analysis of literature phase.FindingsThrough interlinking findings from different disciplines, the study presents a theoretical framework for TK communication. The framework provides architects with an approach to construct and transfer TK while using the computer in a computational design environment, presenting an individual and a social set of conditions and factors revealed from the review of the analyzed literature. The framework particularly emphasizes the significance of a human\u2013computer symbiotic relationship for the process of TK communication to take place.Originality/valueThis paper presents a novel interdisciplinary reading into the literature of fields beyond architectural design, incorporating intangible knowledge domains into the computational design process and expanding the capabilities of computational design tools to allow for the transfer of intangible design attributes between different design entities, particularly tacit design knowledge.", "venue": "Open House International", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 48, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Art", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2021-08-24", "journal": {"name": "Open House International"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2132277385", "name": "Hala Hossam Eldin"}, {"authorId": "1394931314", "name": "Ramy Bakir"}, {"authorId": "1429704981", "name": "S.

Methods An adversarial deep-learning-based auto-segmentation model was trained and configured for cervical cancer CTV contouring using CT data from 237 patients. Then CT scans of additional 20 consecutive patients with locally advanced cervical cancer were collected to perform a three-stage multicenter randomized controlled evaluation involving nine oncologists from six medical centers. This evaluation system is a combination of objective performance metrics, radiation oncologist assessment, and finally the head-to-head Turing imitation test. Accuracy and effectiveness were evaluated step by step. The intra-observer consistency of each oncologist was also tested. Results In stage-1 evaluation, the mean DSC and the 95HD value of the proposed model were 0.88 and 3.46 mm, respectively. In stage-2, the oncologist grading evaluation showed the majority of AI contours were comparable to the GT contours. The average CTV scores for AI and GT were 2.68 vs. 2.71 in week 0 (P = .206), and 2.62 vs. 2.63 in week 2 (P = .552), with no significant statistical differences. In stage-3, the Turing imitation test showed that the percentage of AI contours, which were judged to be better than GT contours by \u22655 oncologists, was 60.0% in week 0 and 42.5% in week 2. Most oncologists demonstrated good consistency between the 2 weeks (P > 0.05).

Applications range from code suggestion and completion to code summarization. However, complete program synthesis of industry-grade programming languages has not been researched extensively. In this work, we introduce a variational autoencoder model for program synthesis of industry-grade programming languages. Our model incorporates the internal hierarchical structure of source codes and operates on parse trees. By learning a latent representation of source code over trees, we capture more information and achieve a higher performance than standard autoregressive autoencoder models. Furthermore, due to the tree-structured nature of our model, the autoregressive operations are performed on paths of trees instead of linear sequences. Therefore, the size of the sequences that the autoregressive model processes, scales proportionally to the width and depth of the tree instead of the total size of the tree which mitigates the common problem of exploding and vanishing gradients.", "venue": "ArXiv", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 46, "citationCount": 1, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-08-16", "journal": {"volume": "abs/2108.07129", "name": "ArXiv"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2123319458", "name": "Sander de Bruin"}, {"authorId": "2066239833", "name": "Vadim Liventsev"}, {"authorId": "1790288", "name": "M.

It can be split into Evolutionary Algorithms, which take inspiration from genetic inheritance, and Swarm Intelligence algorithms, that take inspiration from cultural inheritance. However, recent developments have focused on computational or mathematical adaptions, leaving their biological roots behind. This has left much of the modern evolutionary literature relatively unexplored. To understand which evolutionary mechanisms have been considered, and which have been overlooked, this paper breaks down successful bio-inspired algorithms under a contemporary biological framework based on the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis, an extension of the classical, genetics focussed, Modern Synthesis. The analysis shows that Darwinism and the Modern Synthesis have been incorporated into Evolutionary Computation but that the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis has been broadly ignored beyond:cultural inheritance, incorporated in the sub-set of Swarm Intelligence algorithms, evolvability, through CMA-ES, and multilevel selection, through Multi-Level Selection Genetic Algorithm. The framework shows a missing gap in epigenetic inheritance for Evolutionary Computation, despite being a key building block in modern interpretations of how evolution occurs. Epigenetic inheritance can explain fast adaptation, without changes in an individual\u2019s genotype, by allowing biological organisms to self-adapt quickly to environmental cues, which, increases the speed of convergence while maintaining stability in changing environments.

In this paper, we show how an automated procedure can be used to compare play styles of individual AIand human-controlled characters, and to assess human-likeness and diversity of game participants. INTRODUCTION Fighting games provide a variety of interesting challenges for AI research and development. Fighting is often seen as a purely arcade fun, emphasizing fast reaction and the ability to perform complex combo actions with accurate timing. However, numerous current research works show that designing a good AI for a fighting game is not an easy task. First, achieving high performance is challenging: only one recent work (Oh et al. 2021) reports obtained AI skill level comparable to the abilities of professional human players in a modern fighting game. One of the principal difficulties lies in the fact that people both react to and anticipate opponent\u2019s movements. Thus, a fighting game can be considered as a rock-paper-scissors type game, where opponents make \u201cdouble-blind decisions\u201d (Yu and Sturtevant 2019). Second, people of different skill levels need AI opponents possessing comparable and possibly adjustable skills, which is a separate challenge (Ishihara et al. 2018). Finally, AI-controlled characters have to be believable (human-like) and exhibit diverse play styles to keep the players engaged. Believability and diversity of AI behavior is not a universal requirement across game genres, but for certain game types, such as firstperson shooters, it seems to be the case (Soni and Hingston 2008). Fighting games typically simulate a one-vs-one combat between two human-like opponents, so certain \u201chuman-like traits\u201d are expected form the AI system, at least as a feature contributing to the \u201crealism\u201d of the environment. Before engaging in the task of creating believable and diverse AI-controlled characters for a fighting game, one has first to confirm that the game environment used is able to provide sufficient flexibility for this work. In other words, it should be possible for game characters to exhibit diverse play styles, recognizable by human observers and identifiable distinguishable with a certain evaluation method. The goal of this paper is to analyze play styles of humanand AI-controlled characters in a Universal Fighting Engine (UFE) (Mind Studios 2021). We develop a simple procedure, able to distinguish individual players, which supports the presumption that identifiable behaviors are achievable in UFE. We also compare play styles of people with the style exhibited by a built-in AI system. Finally, we report results of a short survey, aimed to reveal whether human observers can spot \u201chuman-like\u201d traits in the behavior of game characters. UNIVERSAL FIGHTING ENGINE PLATFORM Universal Fighting Engine (Mind Studios 2021) is a highly customizable platform for one-vs-one fighting games developed in Unity. It supports a large variety of attacks and special moves as well as the ability to create new action types on per-character basis. UFE aims to provide classic comboheavy 2D fighting gameplay, associated with games such as Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat. UFE comes with a built-in customizable rule-based AI engine called \u201cFuzzy AI\u201d. It relies on fuzzy logic to evaluate the current scene and estimate the desirability of each given action. Play style and skill level of Fuzzy AI players can be adjusted by tuning a number of parameters, by default organized into presets ranging from \u201cvery easy\u201d to \u201cimpossible\u201d. In the present study we use five different levels of Fuzzy AI with default parameter values shown in Table 1. Table 1: Fuzzy AI settings for five different skill levels For us, each AI preset is essentially a \u201cblack box\u201d aimed to represent a unique fighting game character. Thus, we will not discuss the choice of Fuzzy AI parameters and their values, described in the documentation as follows: \u2022 Time between decisions (sec): minimum time taken to formulate a decision. \u2022 Time between actions (sec): time between executing each decision. \u2022 Rule compliance: controls the balance between systematic appliance of rules and randomicity (higher values correspond to lower randomicity). \u2022 Aggressiveness: controls the balance between basic moves such as walk, crouch and jump, and attacks. Higher values correspond to higher contribution of attacking actions. Very easy Easy Normal Hard Very hard Time between decisions 0.4 0.3 0 0.1 0 Time between actions 0.1 0.1 0.05 0.05 0.05 Rule compliance 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9 Aggressiveness 0.1 0.3 0.5 0.6 0.6 Combo efficiency 0.1 0.2 1 1 1 \u2022 Combo efficiency: controls the probability of attempting combo actions. Universal Fighting Engine comes with a set of pre-modeled characters, distinct in their special move types. To ensure fair comparison, we use the same character type for each of the opponents in all test games. PLAY STYLE SIMILARITY IDENTIFICATION The goals of our work can be narrowed down to the following research questions: RQ1 Do human-controlled and AI-controlled characters possess distinct, identifiable play styles? RQ2 Are these styles consistent across matches or change depending on the opponent? RQ3 Do human-controlled characters possess identifiable \u201chuman-like behavior traits\u201d? RQ4 Can questions RQ1-RQ3 be answered with a certain automated evaluation procedure? In order to compare individual players\u2019 behavior, we adopted a cosine similarity-based procedure, earlier used in the game of boxing (Mozgovoy and Umarov 2010). It operates as follows. We analyze recordings of games where a character of our interest participates and create its \u201cbehavior fingerprint\u201d as an ordered list of probabilities of every possible tuple (A1, A2, A3), representing three consecutive player actions. Recordings consist of game engine state snapshots taken at each consecutive simulation frame. Within this context, each action is uniquely defined with its game engine-specified elements currentState, currentSubstate, and currentBasicMove. While more details are provided in Table 2, we view these elements as merely items uniquely identifying an action in our particular game engine (UFE). Being lists of probabilities, behavior fingerprints can be compared as vectors using cosine similarity, yielding a similarity ratio of [0, 1]:", "venue": "ArXiv", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 14, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2021-08-08", "journal": {"volume": "abs/2108.03599", "name": "ArXiv"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1417585444", "name": "Kaori Yuda"}, {"authorId": "2472741", "name": "Sho Kamei"}, {"authorId": "2122931567", "name": "Riku Tanji"}, {"authorId": "32290176", "name": "Ryoya Ito"}, {"authorId": "2122932793", "name": "Ippo Wakana"}, {"authorId": "49864675", "name": "M.

This extends to regulation and ethical discussion of technology and businesses doing data processing. Liberalism relies on the privacy and autonomy of individuals, their ordering through a public market, and, more recently, a measure of equality guaranteed by the state. We argue that these forms of regulation and ethical analysis are largely incompatible with the techno-political and techno-economic dimensions of artificial intelligence. By analyzing liberal regulatory solutions in the form of privacy and data protection, regulation of public markets, and fairness in AI, we expose how the data economy and artificial intelligence have transcended liberal legal imagination. Organizations use artificial intelligence to exceed the bounded rationality of individuals and each other. This has led to the private consolidation of markets and an unequal hierarchy of control operating mainly for the purpose of shareholder value. An artificial intelligence will be only as ethical as the purpose of the social system that operates it. Inspired by the science of artificial life as an alternative to artificial intelligence, we consider data intermediaries: sociotechnical systems composed of individuals associated around collectively pursued purposes.

In short, artificial intelligence is already able to recognize humour, and reacts to it accordingly. Furthermore, people laugh with humorous machines. However, it is still uncertain whether artificial intelligence can have a sense of humour or not, at least in comparison to a human sense of humour.

Since it is difficult to empirically access mental agency beyond externally measurable behavior, the topic is mainly treated philosophically. However, this has not prevented philosophers from substantiating their arguments with psychological findings, but predominantly with those which allegedly limit the scope and conscious controllability of mental action in favor of automated subpersonal processes. By contrast, the call for a methodological extension through introspective access is particularly noticeable among proponents of a wider significance of mental action. Taking this up, it is shown how an empirical-introspective methodology can obtain a differentiated structure of mental activities occurring in directed thought. The empirical results gained under replicable conditions with 32 participants lead to insights about mental activity regarding (1) immanent causation, (2) content-free intention, (3) active receptivity and (4) its selective openness to mental content, and (5) different levels of observational awareness. These arguments speak for assigning an agentive status to the activities studied and hence for a more significant role of mental action in cognitive processes.", "venue": "Philosophical Psychology", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 74, "citationCount": 2, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Sociology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-07-18", "journal": {"volume": "35", "pages": "145 - 176", "name": "Philosophical Psychology"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "31453852", "name": "Johannes Wagemann"}]}, {"paperId": "2d2b0b8cc25751b4c60361f3a8d8887441be2fdc", "externalIds": {"DBLP": "conf/ijcnn/Weng21", "DOI": "10.1109/IJCNN52387.2021.9533558", "CorpusId": 237599831}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2d2b0b8cc25751b4c60361f3a8d8887441be2fdc", "title": "On Post Selection Using Test Sets (PSUTS) in AI", "abstract": "This is a theory paper.

PSUTS practices have two kinds, machine PSUTS and human PSUTS. The connectionist school received criticisms for its \u201cscruffiness\u201d due to a huge number of scruffy parameters and now the machine PSUTS; but the seemingly \u201cclean\u201d symbolic school seems more brittle than what is known because of using human PSUTS. This paper formally defines what PSUTS is, analyzes why error-backprop methods with random initial weights suffer from severe local minima, why PSUTS violates well-established research ethics, and how every paper that used PSUTS should have at least transparently reported PSUTS data.

Whereas the field started with simple counting of words with certain characteristics, it has grown in complexity with the advent of deep learning and neural network based language models.

This is also the main idea behind the \u201cThoery of Tri-state\u201d in the first part of this paper. The core idea in the theory of \u201cTri-state\u201d is \u201cTri-state Logic\u201d (\u201cpositive | negative | uncertain state\u201d). The ontology of \u201cTri-state Logic\u201d aims to reveal the meta space-time movement law of things transforming from one form to another, that is, the coupling of time and space in the development of things, and the orientation and evolution of the continuity of things. The mathematical basis of \u201cTri-state Logic\u201d is knot theory and dynamics theory. The second part of this paper designs a machine-consciousness model framework based on the \u201cTheory of Tri-state\u201d (Tri-state Logic).

Its function in society\u2019s life has grown exponentially in the last decade, to a point where many of its manifestations such as face recognition or digital voice assistants are taken for granted and generate little or no astonishment in everyday users. Interest for AI application in health care began in the 1990s and soon turned to oncology. Given the large number of women diagnosed with breast cancer every year, this field is an optimal setting for the development of a technology largely based on processing significant amounts of data. Computer-aided detection (CAD) was the first software announced for clinical use in breast cancer diagnosis, and was burdened with significant expectations which were not entirely met since its introduction in the late 1990s [2]. This technology relied on algorithms programmed to analyze digital mammograms in search of the same features of malignancy that radiologists look for when reading an exam (i.e. shape, size, asymmetry etc): \u2018old\u2019 AI was therefore conceived as an enhancement of human intelligence that could be matched with the artificial benefit of processing large quantities of data. Despite encouraging initial results, years of CAD clinical application revealed no significant improvement in comprehensive screening performance, and general hype deflated until a new deep learning (DL) revolution generated a second wave of enthusiasm from the early 2010s [3].", "venue": "Expert review of anticancer therapy", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 28, "citationCount": 1, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["Editorial"], "publicationDate": "2021-07-02", "journal": {"volume": "21", "pages": "1067 - 1070", "name": "Expert Review of Anticancer Therapy"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "49204335", "name": "G.

This paper explores a particular type of moral status that the author terms psychological moral patiency, focusing on the epistemological question of what sort of evidence might lead us to reasonably conclude that a given artificial system qualified as having this status. The paper surveys five possible criteria that might be applied: intuitive judgments, assessments of intelligence, the presence of desires and autonomous behavior, evidence of sentience, and behavioral equivalence. The author suggests that despite its limitations, the latter approach offers the best way forward, and defends a variant of that, termed the cognitive equivalence strategy.

Most variables contain less than 7 bits of real information per value, which are also highly compressible due to spatio-temporal correlation. Rounding bits without real information to zero facilitates lossless compression algorithms and encodes the uncertainty within the data itself. The entire CAMS data is compressed by a factor of 17x, relative to 64-bit floats, while preserving 99% of real information. Combined with 4-dimensional compression to exploit the spatio-temporal correlation, factors beyond 60x are achieved without an increase in forecast errors.

However, while artificial intelligence increases its function in society, the uncertain and unpredictable character of artificial intelligence also creates a new challenge for law, unlike every scientific development. In our assessment, we think that the concepts of electronic personality and legal personality should be emphasized in determining the legal personality and legal status of artificial intelligence. On the other hand, as the types of artificial intelligence develop and the artificial intelligence becomes aware of itself, more complex legal problems will come to the agenda. One of the issues the article focuses on is the dilemma of the law regarding timing and content against artificial intelligence technology, as in every scientific development.

The recent development of end-toend learning has made it possible to bypass multiple intermediate stages of steganographic operations with a pair of encoder and decoder neural networks. This framework is, however, incapable of guaranteeing perfect reversibility since it is difficult for this kind of monolithic machinery, in the form of a black box, to learn the intricate logics of reversible computing. A more reliable way to develop a learning-based reversible steganographic scheme is through a divide-and-conquer paradigm. Predictionerror modulation is a well-established modular framework that consists of an analytics module and a coding module. The former serves the purpose of analysing pixel correlations and predicting pixel intensities, while the latter specialises in reversible coding mechanisms. Given that reversibility is governed independently by the coding module, we narrow our focus to the incorporation of neural networks into the analytics module. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impacts of different training configurations on predictive neural networks and to provide practical insights. Context-aware pixel intensity prediction has a central role in reversible steganography and can be perceived as a lowlevel computer vision task. Therefore, instead of reinventing the wheel, we can adopt neural network models originally designed for such computer vision tasks to perform intensity prediction. Furthermore, we rigorously investigate the effect of intensity initialisation upon predictive performance and the influence of distributional shift in dual-layer prediction.

The need to minimize dynamic power dissipation is vital for combinational circuits. Switching activity is a vital reason for the dissipation of power in combinational circuits, which includes activities like spurious pulses, called glitches. Functional transition and glitch are two types of signal transitions. A glitch is an unnecessary, momentary error in the system before the signal reaches to the anticipated value. Before reaching a stable state, there can be changes in the state of the signal, called glitches. Every toggling causes dissipation of power as a result of charging and discharging of gate capacitance. In the proposed method i.e., uniform minimal switching decimal representation, the increase in the number of 1's serially there will be an increase in the current and hence there are no glitches compared to binary code, where a number of 1's increases at different places. This type of coding has high linearity performance by reducing the clock feed-through effect especially in switching between multiple transistors. In the proposed method, one can prove that uniform minimal switching decimal representation acts as a number system so that all arithmetic operations can be done.

Within this context, neuromorphic intelligence represents a paradigm shift in computing based on the implementation of spiking neural network architectures tightly co-locating processing and memory. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the field, highlighting the different levels of granularity present in existing silicon implementations, comparing approaches that aim at replicating natural intelligence (bottom-up) versus those that aim at solving practical artificial intelligence applications (top-down), and assessing the benefits of the different circuit design styles used to achieve these goals. First, we present the analog, mixed-signal and digital circuit design styles, identifying the boundary between processing and memory through time multiplexing, in-memory computation and novel devices. Next, we highlight the key tradeoffs for each of the bottom-up and top-down approaches, survey their silicon implementations, and carry out detailed comparative analyses to extract design guidelines. Finally, we identify both necessary synergies and missing elements required to achieve a competitive advantage for neuromorphic edge computing over conventional machine-learning accelerators, and outline the key elements for a framework toward neuromorphic intelligence.", "venue": "ArXiv", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 306, "citationCount": 14, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2021-06-02", "journal": {"volume": "abs/2106.01288", "name": "ArXiv"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "38613620", "name": "C.

However, this capability requires processing huge amounts of learning data to extract useful information in real time. The buzz around AI is not new, as this term has been widely known for the past half century. In the 1960s, scientists began to think about machines acting more like humans, which resulted in the development of the first natural language processing computers. It laid the foundation of AI, but there were only a handful of applications until the 1990s due to limitations in processing speed, memory, and computational power available. Since the 1990s, advancements in computer architecture and memory organization have enabled microprocessors to deliver much higher performance. Simultaneously, improvements in the understanding and mathematical representation of AI gave birth to its subset, referred to as machine learning (ML). ML includes different algorithms for independent learning, and the most promising ones are based on brain-inspired techniques classified as artificial neural networks (ANNs). ANNs have subsequently evolved to have deeper and larger structures and are often characterized as deep neural networks (DNN) and convolution neural networks (CNN). In tandem with the emergence of multicore processors, ML techniques started to be embedded in a range of scenarios and applications. Recently, application-specific instruction-set architecture for AI applications has also been supported in different microprocessors. Thus, continuous improvement in microprocessor capabilities has reached a stage where it is now possible to implement complex real-time intelligent applications like computer vision, object identification, speech recognition, data security, spectrum sensing, etc. This paper presents an overview on the evolution of AI and how the increasing capabilities of microprocessors have fueled the adoption of AI in a plethora of application domains.

Until now, the proposed visual tests heavily use natural language processing to conduct the questionnaire or storytelling. We deviate from the mainstream, and we propose to reframe the visual Turing test through the Kuleshov effect to avoid written or spoken language. The idea resides on elucidating a method that creates the concept of montage synthetically. Like the first days of cinema, we would like to convey messages with the interpretation of image shots that a machine could decipher while comparing it with those scored by humans. The first implementation of this new test uses images from a psychology study where the circumplex model is applied to rate each image.

Investing in new technology, continually touted as the answer for analytic troubles, seems far less difficult in the short run than trying to find consensus about a long-term vision. It is easier to develop a nuclear missile, for example, than to give a universal definition of peace, and this is what the history of the XX century was all about. While intelligence analysis is still a necessary tool for decision-makers, it is unclear who or what will perform this function in the future. Though the solution cannot be only technological, the current trajectory tells a different story whereby the human analysts are removed from their central position to make way for Artificial Intelligence. What one can reasonably ask of an officer is that he should possess a standard of judgment, which he can gain only from knowledge of men and affairs and from common sense.

In order to do so, participants played the judges in a Turing test between a normal conversation (written with the traditional writing style) and a conversation in which the experimenter was conversing with textisms, in a random order.

In this paper, we present a holistic approach to identify and model individual race driving styles in a robust way. We develop the Driver Identification and Metric Ranking Algorithm (DIMRA) as a data-based method for an in-depth objective analysis and assessment of professional race drivers. Supported by this knowledge, we extend and adapt the imitation learning framework Probabilistic Modeling of Driver Behavior (ProMoD) in order to model race drivers in a complex simulation environment. An evaluation with data from professional race drivers shows the capability of DIMRA to derive metrics which describe human race driving styles, as well as ProMoD to robustly generate competitive laps with human-like controls in a professional motorsport driving simulator.

When turning to Artificial Intelligence, the above dichotomy can be translated into the distinction between autonomous agents, which learn in isolation from their own signals, and interactive learning agents which can be taught by social partners but generally lack autonomy. In between should stand teachable autonomous agents: agents that learn from both internal and teaching signals to benefit from the higher efficiency of assisted discovery processes. Designing such agents could result in progress in two ways. First, very concretely, it would offer a way to non-expert users in the real world to drive the learning behavior of agents towards their expectations. Second, more fundamentally, it might be a key step to endow agents with the necessary capabilities to reach general intelligence. The purpose of this paper is to elucidate the key obstacles standing in the way towards the design of such agents. We proceed in four steps. First, we build on a seminal work of Bruner to extract relevant features of the assisted discovery processes happening between a child and a tutor. Second, we highlight how current research on intrinsically motivated agents is paving the way towards teachable and autonomous agents. In particular, we focus on autotelic agents, i.e. agents equipped with forms of intrinsic motivations that enable them to represent, self-generate and pursue their own goals. We argue that such autotelic capabilities from the learner side are key in the discovery process. Third, we adopt a social learning perspective on the interaction between a tutor and a learner to highlight some components that are currently missing to these agents before they can be taught by ordinary people using natural pedagogy.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our automated NTT on a navigation task in a complex 3D environment. We investigate six classification models to shed light on the types of architectures best suited to this task, and validate them against data collected through a human NTT.

Recent findings Several recent studies have shed light on the promising potential of AI in functional urology to investigate lower urinary tract dysfunction pathophysiology but also as a diagnostic tool by enhancing the existing evaluations such as dynamic magnetic resonance imaging or urodynamics. AI may also improve surgical education and training because of its automated performance metrics recording. By bringing prediction models, AI may also have strong therapeutic implications in the field of functional urology in the near future. AI may also be implemented in innovative devices such as e-bladder diary and electromechanical artificial urinary sphincter and could facilitate the development of remote medicine. Summary Over the past decade, the enthusiasm for AI has been rising exponentially. Machine learning was well known, but the increasing power of processors and the amount of data available has provided the platform for deep learning tools to expand.

Today, virtual assistants often return irrelevant answers to such utterances, except for hard-coded ones addressed by canned replies. To address the challenge of automatically detecting playful utterances, we first characterize the different types of playful human-virtual assistant interaction. We introduce a taxonomy of playful requests rooted in theories of humor and refined by analyzing real-world traffic from Alexa. We then focus on one node, personification, where users refer to the virtual assistant as a person (\u201cWhat do you do for fun?\u201d). Our conjecture is that understanding such utterances will improve user experience with virtual assistants. We conducted a Wizard-of-Oz user study and showed that endowing virtual assistants with the ability to identify humorous opportunities indeed has the potential to increase user satisfaction.

In turn, these capabilities have made AI a viable replacement for many human activities that at their core involve classification, such as basic mechanical and analytical tasks in low-level service jobs. Current systems do not need to be conscious to recognize patterns and classify them. 1 However, for AI to progress to more complicated tasks requiring intuition and empathy, it must develop capabilities such as metathinking, creativity, and empathy akin to human self-awareness or consciousness.

If the explorative routines provoke creativity and critical thinking which are delivered by humans, exploitative routines induce repetitive actions and mimic activities which are executed by humanoids. This has raised the need for a better balance between both routines involving an ambidextrous dynamic process. Here, product innovations play a relevant role in enhancing such balance and labour productivity. If, from the conceptual standpoint, this phenomenon has already been explored, there is still the need to empirically analyse it. We thus offer a meso-analysis of twenty-four countries located in Europe through the lens of the Service Robot Deployment (SRD) Model and the conceptual lens of organizational ambidexterity. By a regression methodology, the results show that humanoid robot adoption is still not affecting labour productivity which, by contrast, is positively and significantly connected with both radically new and marginally modified/unchanged production of innovative routines. Our original contribution, which falls in the field of Human Resources Management and Artificial Intelligence, is that humanoids are not directly impacting labour productivity but indirectly through the generation of both new and marginally modified (or unchanged) routines. This situation persuades senior leaders to achieve a balance between exploitative and explorative product innovation routines.

One of the main differences between regular engineering problems and artistic expressions is that goals and constraints are usually ill-defined in the latter case; in fact the rules here could or should be transgressed more regularly. For this reason, our approach does not use a pre-existing dataset to imitate or extract rules from. Instead, it uses formal grammars as a representation method than can retain just the basic features, common to any form of music (e.g., the appearance of rhythmic patterns, the evolution of tone or dynamics during the composition, etc.). Exploring different musical spaces is the responsibility of a program interface that translates musical specifications into the fitness function of a genetic algorithm. This function guides the evolution of those basic features enabling the emergence of novel content. In this study, we then assess the outcome of a particular music specification (guitar ballad) in a controlled real-world setup. As a result, the generated music can be considered similar to human-composed music from a perceptual perspective.

Every detail of this portrayal was an exercise in World Building, with careful considerations of then state-of-the-art technology and informed predictions. Kubrick\u2019s speculative vision is comparative to the practice of Design Fiction, by suspending disbelief and leveraging a technologies emergence to question the future\u2019s sociotechnical landscape and its ramifications critically. Discovery\u2019s AI system, Hal9000, is a convincing speculation of intelligence with Kubrick\u2019s vision showcasing current and long-term aims in AI research. To this end, Hal9000 uniquely portrays Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) underpinned by visualising \u2018narrow\u2019 AI subproblems; thereby, simultaneously highlighting then current research agendas within AI and manifesting them into the aspirational research agenda of human-computer symbiosis. As a result of Kubrick\u2019s mastery in suspending a viewer\u2019s disbelief despite portraying a particular reality for AI, and humanities fascination with artificial life, the term AI simultaneously refers to the grand vision of AGI as well as relating to the contemporary reality of narrow AI. This confusion, along with establishing AI\u2019s ontology, are current challenges that need addressing to create effective and acceptable realisations of AI. This paper responds to the ontological confusion by reviewing and comparing Kubrick\u2019s speculative methodology to the practice of Design Fiction by unpacking Hal9000 as a diegetic prototype while defining the active threads of \u2018AI\u2019s Definitional Dualism\u2019. The paper will also present a Design Fiction submerged in the reality of narrow AI and the adoption of a More-Than Human Centred Design approach to address the complexity of AI\u2019s ontology in alternative ways.

This article focuses on chatbots which have been proposed as an efficient method to improve communication with, and accountability to affected communities. Chatbots, together with other humanitarian AI applications such as biometrics, satellite imaging, predictive modelling and data visualisations, are often understood as part of the wider phenomenon of \u2018AI for social good\u2019. The article develops a decolonial critique of humanitarianism and critical algorithm studies which focuses on the power asymmetries underpinning both humanitarianism and AI. The article asks whether chatbots, as exemplars of \u2018AI for good\u2019, reproduce inequalities in the global context. Drawing on a mixed methods study that includes interviews with seven groups of stakeholders, the analysis observes that humanitarian chatbots do not fulfil claims such as \u2018intelligence\u2019. Yet AI applications still have powerful consequences. Apart from the risks associated with misinformation and data safeguarding, chatbots reduce communication to its barest instrumental forms which creates disconnects between affected communities and aid agencies. This disconnect is compounded by the extraction of value from data and experimentation with untested technologies. By reflecting the values of their designers and by asserting Eurocentric values in their programmed interactions, chatbots reproduce the coloniality of power. The article concludes that \u2018AI for good\u2019 is an \u2018enchantment of technology\u2019 that reworks the colonial legacies of humanitarianism whilst also occluding the power dynamics at play.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 81, "citationCount": 6, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-04-26", "journal": {"volume": "24", "pages": "850 - 868", "name": "Information, Communication & Society"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2850262", "name": "Mirca Madianou"}]}, {"paperId": "bb3026f8fb7815720e3d84613b48300c130e44e4", "externalIds": {"DBLP": "journals/corr/abs-2104-12871", "ArXiv": "2104.12871", "DOI": "10.1145/3449639.3465421", "CorpusId": 233407771}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bb3026f8fb7815720e3d84613b48300c130e44e4", "title": "Why AI is harder than we think", "abstract": "Since its beginning in the 1950s, the field of artificial intelligence has cycled several times between periods of optimistic predictions and massive investment (\"AI Spring\") and periods of disappointment, loss of confidence, and reduced funding (\"AI Winter\").

Our analysis focuses on the role of \u201cassertions\u201d: textual contexts that provide indirect clues about the underlying semantics. We study whether assertions enable a system to emulate representations preserving semantic relations like equivalence. We find that assertions enable semantic emulation of languages that satisfy a strong notion of semantic transparency. However, for classes of languages where the same expression can take different values in different contexts, we show that emulation can become uncomputable. Finally, we discuss differences between our formal model and natural language, exploring how our results generalize to a modal setting and other semantic relations.

We also asked participants to identify their political affinity and assess the articles\u2019 political tone to gain insight into the relationship between political leaning and article perception. Our results indicate that the May 2019 release of OpenAI\u2019s GPT-2 model generated articles that were misidentified as written by a human close to half the time, while human-written articles were identified correctly as written by a human about 70 percent of the time.", "venue": "Digital Threats: Research and Practice", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 61, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Business", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-04-20", "journal": {"volume": "2", "pages": "1 - 16", "name": "Digital Threats: Research and Practice"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2086786251", "name": "Shubhra Tewari"}, {"authorId": "1753691816", "name": "Renos Zabounidis"}, {"authorId": "116150549", "name": "Ammina Kothari"}, {"authorId": "39958072", "name": "Reynold J.

However, existing trainable dialogue evaluation models are generally restricted to classifiers trained in a purely supervised manner, which suffer a significant risk from adversarial attacking (e.g., a nonsensical response that enjoys a high classification score). To alleviate this risk, we propose an adversarial training approach to learn a robust model, ATT (Adversarial Turing Test), that discriminates machine-generated responses from human-written replies. In contrast to previous perturbation-based methods, our discriminator is trained by iteratively generating unrestricted and diverse adversarial examples using reinforcement learning. The key benefit of this unrestricted adversarial training approach is allowing the discriminator to improve robustness in an iterative attack-defense game.

In this paper, we propose a novel transformer-based Updater-Extractor architecture and a training procedure that can work with sequences of arbitrary length and refine its knowledge about the world based on linguistic inputs. We explicitly train the model to incorporate incoming information into its world state representation, obtaining strong inductive generalization and the ability to handle extremely long-range dependencies.

These tools traditionally take semantically labeled samples of the available data (known facts) as an input for learning. We want to challenge the indispensability of this approach, and we suggest considering the things the other way around. What if the task would be as follows: how to build a model based on the semantics of our ignorance, i.e., by processing the shape of \u201cvoids\u201d within the available data space?

Furthermore, GLRMs have the potential to handle missing data in ways previously unexplored in the discipline.

There is no standardization of what is machine intelligence and what should be measured to quantify it. In this study, we investigate the measurement of intelligence from the viewpoint of real-life difficult-problem-solving abilities, and we highlight the importance of being able to make accurate and robust comparisons between multiple cooperative multiagent systems (CMASs) using a novel metric. A recent metric presented in the scientific literature, called MetrIntPair, is capable of comparing the intelligence of only two CMASs at an application. In this paper, we propose a generalization of that metric called MetrIntPairII. MetrIntPairII is based on pairwise problem-solving intelligence comparisons (for the same problem, the problem-solving intelligence of the studied CMASs is evaluated experimentally in pairs). The pairwise intelligence comparison is proposed to decrease the necessary number of experimental intelligence measurements. MetrIntPairII has the same properties as MetrIntPair, with the main advantage that it can be applied to any number of CMASs conserving the accuracy of the comparison, while it exhibits enhanced robustness. An important property of the proposed metric is the universality, as it can be applied as a black-box method to intelligent agent-based systems (IABSs) generally, not depending on the aspect of IABS architecture. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the MetrIntPairII metric, we provide a representative experimental study, comparing the intelligence of several CMASs composed of agents specialized in solving an NP-hard problem.", "venue": "Mathematics", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 85, "citationCount": 4, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-03-22", "journal": {"name": "Mathematics"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2983864", "name": "L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Barna Iantovics"}]}, {"paperId": "eb266c80be4904a62ca29d1ba8511e4129cc49f0", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1016/j.jcct.2021.03.006", "CorpusId": 233027364, "PubMed": "33812855"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/eb266c80be4904a62ca29d1ba8511e4129cc49f0", "title": "Artificial intelligence in cardiovascular CT: Current status and future implications.", "abstract": null, "venue": "Journal of cardiovascular computed tomography", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 51, "citationCount": 8, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-03-22", "journal": {"name": "Journal of cardiovascular computed tomography"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "81728867", "name": "A.

To this end, a narrative is conveyed that allows the reader to develop an objective view on current developments that is free from false promises that dominate public communication. An essential takeaway for the reader is that AI must be understood as an umbrella term encompassing a plethora of different methods, schools of thought, and their respective historical movements. Consequently, a bottom-up strategy is pursued in which the field of AI is introduced by presenting various aspects that are characteristic of the subject. This paper is structured in three parts: (i) Discussion of current trends revealing false public narratives, (ii) an introduction to the history of AI focusing on recurring patterns and main characteristics, and (iii) a critical discussion on the limitations of current methods in the context of the potential emergence of a strong(er) AI. It should be noted that this work does not cover any of these aspects holistically; rather, the content addressed is a selection made by the author and subject to a didactic strategy. 1 Today\u2019s Perspectives on AI Undoubtedly, advances in AI have enormous implications on societies, politics, and industries, which has resulted in an increasing attention over the past few years. The tremendous value from leveraging AI-based approaches is becoming more and more apparent in a wide variety of different areas, such as (i) drug discovery in medicine (an example is given by Ramsundar et al. [1]), (ii) theoretical research where AI allows to systematically search hypothesis space to find unbiased, repeatable, and optimal results based on big data sets (for instance, see [2]), or (iii) transportation where researchers strive for fully autonomous driving [3]. Especially data-driven technologies are already transforming entire industries by improving processes or paving the way for fundamentally new business models [4]. It\u2019s worth noting that the huge popularity of AI is fueled by the fact that the world\u2019s most successful companies sit on enormous data lakes of mostly personal data, forming powerful monopolies changing the way we live (GoogleTM, FacebookTM, or AmazonTM). Commercially viable business models are typically built on exceedingly narrow models to be competitive as similar to humans specialization usually leads to superior performance. Products from big tech corporates are ubiquitous in our everyday lives and may have led to a widespread misunderstanding of what AI is. Truth to be told, it is exceptionally difficult to define the term intelligence on its own, which naturally also applies to the term (AI). To complicate comprehension of the term \"AI\" even further, the societal view of AI is taken ad absurdum by unscientific debates or science fiction [5]. In addition, one can often observe unrealistic product advertisement when new products based on ordinary software development are sold as being based on advanced AI techniques, as \"AI\" is currently a very marketable keyword. Besides the confusion that is conveyed by public communication, the field of AI is difficult to understand as it comprises a wide variety of different schools of thought and methodologies. Furthermore, the public discussion is dominated by extremes. On the one hand, AI evangelists appear who \u2217primary contact: noah.klarmann@tum.de ar X iv :2 10 3. 11 96 1v 1 [ cs .A I] 1 8 M ar 2 02 1 Artificial Intelligence Narratives: An Objective Perspective on Current Developments push away any concerns. On the other hand, there are people who advocate an overly skeptical view on AI; for example, by portraying a dystopian world in which robots enslave humanity. It is obvious that all these mechanisms inevitably have an enormous impact on the way AI is viewed today. For instance, young people of generations \"Y\" and \"Z\" mostly associate AI with business models from big tech companies that exploit AI, as this is the most visible aspect of their lifetime to date. At the same time, individuals from the \"Boomer\" and \"X\" generations are possibly more skeptical about current developments in AI, primarily due to two distinct aspects that characterized the field of AI in the 20th century: (i) Reaching milestones usually caused disappointment when the anticipated technological revolution did not occur. For example, IBM\u2019s Deep Blue defeated the world grandmaster Garri Kasparov in 1997 [6] that lead to great attention in the scientific world and also beyond. Apparently, it was a great surprise to the public when the agent that is able to master such an intellectual task as chess would not made a good lawyer or taxi driver. (ii) It has happened several times that entire industries with questionable AI-based business models have perished when high expectations led to disappointment among society and stakeholders as extravagant promises remained unfulfilled. Although skepticism and misconceptions are evident, AI is undoubtedly playing an increasingly important role in our daily lives, leading to growing concerns about privacy [7], security [8], fairness [9], or the threat posed by autonomous military agents [10]. Consequently, regulation and standardization of AI methods are crucial to constrain the development in a way that corresponds to mankind\u2019s expectations [11, 12]. In this context, two concerns commonly appear: (i) Higher degrees of automation are associated with job losses as machines substitute human labor. In fact, a survey among researchers revealed a predicted chance of 50% that AI will be superior to human in almost every task within the next 42 years (until 2063) and could replace all human labor within the next 117 years (by 2138) [13]. However, it should be noted that substituted jobs do not necessarily lead to unemployment in the short term. Miller and Atkinson [14] advocate that the \"job loss\" argument is based on a common fallacy, namely the claim that the number of jobs decreases with increasing automation/productivity. In history however, no correlation between productivity and unemployment can be identified. The wrong assumption of job losses is based on the hypothesis that there is a limit amount of labor that does not rise with increasing productivity. This is a wrong assumption as savings due to increased productivity recycles back to economy, rising the demand for products that in turn lead to more jobs. In addition, new jobs are also created in the prospering automation/AI industry [14]. It is worth noting that a major risk for industrial ecosystems is to refuse the highest possible level of automation, as this would lead to a loss of competitiveness. (ii) A second often raised issue is that advanced techniques are black-box models and hence, cannot be controlled and might sooner or later emerge towards something with an own will (see for instance [11]). While it is true that many of the currently used methods are black-box models (for example, machine learning), they are by no means self-organizing or emergent (yet). It is also worth noting that significant efforts are being made by researchers to develop explainable AI to make use of machine learning with more caution (especially in safety-critical areas such as autonomous driving or in the medical field) or to derive knowledge from machine learning models (an overview on this topic can be found by Tjoa and Guan [15]). Despite the great success in employing AI methods, there is a significant lack of understanding in society, as well as among scientists. To this end, this paper provides an objective overview of the field of AI by addressing the most important characteristics. The author is convinced that this bottom-up approach (starting from what AI encompasses) is the best strategy from a didactic point of view. The alternative (a topdown approach) would imply to introduce a high-level definition that has to be exceedingly broad/complex and would hence be difficult to formulate/understand. In the next section, an introduction to the history of AI is given. Different eras that were prevalent in the past as well as important events, such as Milestones, are presented. A look at the recent past shows that trends in AI are often temporary, may change significantly over time, were adopted by other methods, or branch into different disciplines. In the subsequent section, an outlook on possible future developments is given. 2 Characteristics of AI history A brief introduction to the history of AI is provided in this section. Besides conveying known facts, main characteristics of AI are presented to support the reader in the comprehension of current developments and to derive possible scenarios for the future. On a high level, the history of AI can be categorized into four phases, as shown in Figure 1. The four phases differ primarily in the contemporary conceptions of the respective researchers regarding the best approach that could eventually lead to higher intelligence. Furthermore, Figure 2 shows a detailed timeline of the history of AI with a selection of different milestones and events. The first phase in Figure 1 Cybernetics (mainly between 1943 1955) can be seen as the pioneering stage before AI emerged. Cybernetics is defined as the study of the fundamentals of the control and communication in animals and machines [18].

Non-verbal signals impact the meaning of the spoken utterance in an abundance of ways. An absence of non-verbal signals impoverishes the process of communication. Yet, when users are represented as avatars, it is difficult to translate non-verbal signals along with the speech into the virtual world without specialized motion-capture hardware. In this paper, we propose a novel, data-driven technique for generating gestures directly from speech. Our approach is based on the application of Generative Adversarial Neural Networks (GANs) to model the correlation rather than causation between speech and gestures. This approach approximates neuroscience findings on how non-verbal communication and speech are correlated. We create a large dataset which consists of speech and corresponding gestures in a 3D human pose format from which our model learns the speaker-specific correlation. We evaluate the proposed technique in a user study that is inspired by the Turing test. For the study, we animate the generated gestures on a virtual character. We find that users are not able to distinguish between the generated and the recorded gestures.

One important area of study is machines imitating human thinking. Although there are various approaches to development of thinking machines, we assume that human thinking is not always optimal in this paper. Sometimes, humans are driven by emotions to make decisions that are not optimal. Recently, deep learning has been dominating most machine learning tasks in AI. In the area of optimal decisions involving AI, many traditional machine learning methods are rapidly being replaced by deep learning. Therefore, because of deep learning, we can expect the faster growth of AI technology such as AlphaGo in optimal decision-making. However, humans sometimes think and act not optimally but emotionally. In this paper, we propose a method for building thinking machines imitating humans using Bayesian decision theory and learning. Bayesian statistics involves a learning process based on prior and posterior aspects. The prior represents an initial belief in a specific domain. This is updated to posterior through the likelihood of observed data. The posterior refers to the updated belief based on observations. When the observed data are newly added, the current posterior is used as a new prior for the updated posterior. Bayesian learning such as this also provides an optimal decision; thus, this is not well-suited to the modeling of thinking machines. Therefore, we study a new Bayesian approach to developing thinking machines using Bayesian decision theory. In our research, we do not use a single optimal value expected by the posterior; instead, we generate random values from the last updated posterior to be used for thinking machines that imitate human thinking.", "venue": "Symmetry", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 68, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-02-27", "journal": {"volume": "13", "pages": "389", "name": "Symmetry"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2052577018", "name": "Sunghae Jun"}]}, {"paperId": "0f61f9cd3483eef14614a301557439f6008b9074", "externalIds": {"DBLP": "journals/ki/Butz21", "DOI": "10.1007/s13218-021-00705-x", "CorpusId": 232433494}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0f61f9cd3483eef14614a301557439f6008b9074", "title": "Towards Strong AI", "abstract": null, "venue": "K\u00fcnstliche Intell.", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 120, "citationCount": 7, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-02-26", "journal": {"volume": "35", "pages": "91-101", "name": "KI - K\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1732540", "name": "Martin Volker Butz"}]}, {"paperId": "79640acf4ec1b666a56facebd2db2bf9a2b29959", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3131579087", "DOI": "10.22158/JRPH.V4N1P52", "CorpusId": 233931683}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/79640acf4ec1b666a56facebd2db2bf9a2b29959", "title": "The Fuzzy Completeness Theory", "abstract": "The Two Incompleteness Theorems of Kurt Friedrich G\u00f6del and the Impossibility Theorem of Kenneth Arrow claim that logic, the most reliable of human knowledge, is incomplete or can be inconsistent. The Fuzzy Completeness Theory states that the Fuzzy Logic of Lotfi A. Zadeh has resolved the incompleteness and impossibility in logic and made logic complete and knowledge reliable with the new concept of Range of Tolerance, within which logic is still complete and knowledge, valid. In the Age of Reason about 300 years ago just prior to the Age of Science, reasoning is free for all, without the constraint of the laws of nature, which would be discovered in the Age of Science. However, the Scientific Method of reasoning by empirical verification depends so much on faith that it is logically and empirically dismissed by mathematicians and logicians, especially, after the exposure by Thomas Kuhn and Paul Feyerabend that a scientific advancement is akin to a religious conversion. On the other hand, mathematicians and logicians have been working steadily to find the limit of reliable knowledge. In the current state of knowledge, Kurt G\u00f6del has the last word with his Two Incompleteness Theorems, which conclude that the most reliable of human knowledge, logic, is incomplete, casting doubt whether knowledge is completely reliable. G\u00f6del\u2019s view is further supported by the Impossibility Theorem of Kenneth Arrow. However, Zadeh and the author of this paper extend Zadeh\u2019s concept of Range of Value in Fuzzy Logic to that of Range of Tolerance. Accordingly, Fuzzy Logic deals with the sacrifice of precision in the process of expanding the Range of Tolerance of a creation in order for the creation to survive and flourish for all the possibility of an uncertain future. In knowledge, incompleteness in logic can be resolved by the Range of Tolerance covering the incomplete part or ignoring the infrequent impossibilities, and, thus, making logic valid, again. Knowledge is derived generally from reason. Technically, the Fuzzy Completeness Theory classifies 16 Methods of Reason. The 16 Methods are the combination of the 4 basic Methods of Reason: 1) Logic, 2) Mathematics, 3) Empirical Verification, and 4) Others, each of which has 2 forms: 1) Fuzzy and 2) Exact and two types: 1) Complete and 2) Incomplete. G\u00f6del, Arrow, and the Author agree that no matter how rigorous is the Method of Reason the reason cannot be complete, when the reason is Exact. When a solution is newly defined as an answer within the Range of Tolerance of the solution, Fuzzy Logic resolves the incompleteness in logic and becomes the new foundation of knowledge, replacing Exact Logic. With this definition of a solution, Fuzzy Logic covers the incomplete or the impossible parts of the solution by expanding sufficiently the Range of Tolerance to make reason complete and knowledge reliable, but only within the Range of Tolerance. To summarize, even though the world\u2019s leading intellectuals have proven, directly, that logic is incomplete and, indirectly, that knowledge is invalid, reality is still operating smoothly, and science has even demonstrated the power of knowledge. The conflict between the most reliable knowledge, namely, logic and the real world is resolved by Fuzzy Logic, which introduces the new concept of Range of Tolerance, within which reality can still operate in accordance with the laws discovered by knowledge. In sum, reality is fuzzy, not exact. The breakthrough impact of this paper centers around completeness theory and Fuzzy Logic. In the early 21st century, the mainstream knowledge is still not aware that the supply and demand model is incomplete, and that the DNA-protein system resembles computer science based on logic more than science based on experimentation. The current computer is based on exact logic and is designed for temporary existence, while the living system is design for permanent existence and must depend on the Range of Tolerance based on Fuzzy Logic to survive permanently in an uncertain future. Financial crises will be caused by the unstable investment return, which is the incomplete part in the supply demand model. Complexity crises will be caused by the lack of the requirement of permanence or complete automation, which is the ultimate solution to unlimited complexity.

The laws mainly describe the exponential growth in a particular field, be it the processing, storage or transmission capabilities of electronic devices. Other rules describe the relations to production prices and human interaction. Overall, the IS laws illustrate the most recent and most vibrant part of human history based on the unprecedented growth of device capabilities spurred by human innovation and ingenuity. Although there are signs of stalling, at the same time there are still many ways to prolong the fascinating progress of electronics that stimulates the field of artificial intelligence. There are constant leaps in new areas, such as the perception of real-world signals, where AI is already occasionally exceeding human capabilities and will do so even more in the future. In some areas where AI is presumed to be incapable of performing even at a modest level, such as the production of art or programming software, AI is making progress that can sometimes reflect true human skills.

An ideal environment for evaluating dialog systems, also known as the Turing test, needs to involve human interaction, which is usually not affordable for large-scale experiments. Though researchers have attempted to use metrics for language generation tasks (e.g., perplexity, BLEU) or some model-based reinforcement learning methods (e.g., self-play evaluation) for automatic evaluation, these methods only show very weak correlation with the actual human evaluation in practice. To bridge such a gap, we propose a new framework named ENIGMA for estimating human evaluation scores based on recent advances of off-policy evaluation in reinforcement learning. ENIGMA only requires a handful of pre-collected experience data, and therefore does not involve human interaction with the target policy during the evaluation, making automatic evaluations feasible. More importantly, ENIGMA is model-free and agnostic to the behavior policies for collecting the experience data, which significantly alleviates the technical difficulties of modeling complex dialogue environments and human behaviors. Our experiments show that ENIGMA significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of correlation with human evaluation scores.", "venue": "EMNLP", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 86, "citationCount": 7, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2021-02-20", "journal": {"pages": "7419-7451"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "5795999", "name": "Haoming Jiang"}, {"authorId": "144445937", "name": "Bo Dai"}, {"authorId": "46235335", "name": "Mengjiao Yang"}, {"authorId": "2149192597", "name": "Wei Wei"}, {"authorId": "36345161", "name": "T.

Although digital tools may help mitigate this issue, critics have suggested that technological solutions that lack human empathy will prevent a bond or therapeutic alliance from being formed, thereby narrowing these solutions\u2019 efficacy. Objective We aimed to investigate whether users of a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)\u2013based conversational agent would report therapeutic bond levels that are similar to those in literature about other CBT modalities, including face-to-face therapy, group CBT, and other digital interventions that do not use a conversational agent. Methods A cross-sectional, retrospective study design was used to analyze aggregate, deidentified data from adult users who self-referred to a CBT-based, fully automated conversational agent (Woebot) between November 2019 and August 2020. Working alliance was measured with the Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised (WAI-SR), and depression symptom status was assessed by using the 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2). All measures were administered by the conversational agent in the mobile app. WAI-SR scores were compared to those in scientific literature abstracted from recent reviews. Results Data from 36,070 Woebot users were included in the analysis. Participants ranged in age from 18 to 78 years, and 57.48% (20,734/36,070) of participants reported that they were female. The mean PHQ-2 score was 3.03 (SD 1.79), and 54.67% (19,719/36,070) of users scored over the cutoff score of 3 for depression screening. Within 5 days of initial app use, the mean WAI-SR score was 3.36 (SD 0.8) and the mean bond subscale score was 3.8 (SD 1.0), which was comparable to those in recent studies from the literature on traditional, outpatient, individual CBT and group CBT (mean bond subscale scores of 4 and 3.8, respectively). PHQ-2 scores at baseline weakly correlated with bond scores (r=\u22120.04; P<.001); however, users with depression and those without depression had high bond scores of 3.45. Conclusions Although bonds are often presumed to be the exclusive domain of human therapeutic relationships, our findings challenge the notion that digital therapeutics are incapable of establishing a therapeutic bond with users. Future research might investigate the role of bonds as mediators of clinical outcomes, since boosting the engagement and efficacy of digital therapeutics could have major public health benefits.", "venue": "JMIR formative research", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 25, "citationCount": 23, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2021-02-10", "journal": {"volume": "5", "name": "JMIR Formative Research"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "6120000", "name": "Alison M Darcy"}, {"authorId": "2091471950", "name": "Jade Daniels"}, {"authorId": "2077632364", "name": "D.

This new dynamic has caught the attention of political leaders who are finding ways to restrain or regulate AI in public services, but also of scholars who are raising legitimate concerns about its impacts on public employment. In light of the above, the aim of this research is to analyze the influence of AI on public employment and the ways politics are reacting. \nDesign/Methodology/Approach: We have performed a systematic literature review to disclose the state-of-the-art and to find new avenues for future research. \nResults: The results indicate that public services require four kinds of intelligence \u2013 mechanical, analytical, intuitive, and empathetic \u2013 albeit, with much less expression than in private services. \nLimitations of the investigation: This systematic review provides a snapshot of the influence of AI on public employment. Thus, our research does not cover the whole body of knowledge, but it presents a holistic understanding of the phenomenon. \nPractical implications: As private companies are typically more advanced in the implementation of AI technologies, the for-profit sector may provide significant contributions in the way states can leverage public services through the deployment of AI technologies. \nOriginality/Value: This article highlights the need for states to create the necessary conditions to legislate and regulate key technological advances, which, in our opinion, has been done, but at a very slow pace.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 103, "citationCount": 4, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Business", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Political Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2021-01-29", "journal": {"volume": "18", "pages": "1-22", "name": "Brazilian journal of operations & production management"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1455925165", "name": "Jo\u00e3o Reis"}, {"authorId": "144179439", "name": "Paula Esp\u00edrito Santo"}, {"authorId": "3003920", "name": "N.

This study uses a collection of rock music MIDI files which the notes, chords, pitches and duration are extracted as features. A Bayesian network is selected as the main model for this research and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network as the benchmark model. A Turing test was performed on 20 people for both models and the LSTM on average was identified as human-made 36% of the time, while the Bayesian network, on average, had been misidentified 39% of the time.

In particular, the application of AI to a wide variety of satellite communication aspects has demonstrated excellent potential, including beam-hopping, anti-jamming, network traffic forecasting, channel modeling, telemetry mining, ionospheric scintillation detecting, interference managing, remote sensing, behavior modeling, space-air-ground integrating, and energy managing. This work thus provides a general overview of AI, its diverse sub-fields, and its state-of-the-art algorithms.

Deep learning (DL) has had unprecedented success and is now entering scienti\ufb01c computing with full force. However, current DL methods typically suffer from instability, even when universal approximation properties guarantee the existence of stable neural networks (NNs). We address this paradox by demonstrating basic well-conditioned problems in scienti\ufb01c computing where one can prove the existence of NNs with great approximation qualities, however, there does not exist any algorithm, even randomised, that can train (or compute) such a NN. For any positive integers K > 2 and L , there are cases where simultaneously: (a) no randomised training algorithm can compute a NN correct to K digits with probability greater than 1 / 2 , (b) there exists a deterministic training algorithm that computes a NN with K \u2212 1 correct digits, but any such (even randomised) algorithm needs arbitrarily many training data, (c) there exists a deterministic training algorithm that computes a NN with K \u2212 2 correct digits using no more than L training samples. These results imply a classi\ufb01cation theory describing conditions under which (stable) NNs with a given accuracy can be computed by an algorithm. We begin this theory by establishing suf\ufb01cient conditions for the existence of algorithms that compute stable NNs in inverse problems. We introduce Fast Iterative REstarted NETworks (FIRENETs), which we both prove and numerically verify are stable. Moreover, we prove that only O ( | log( (cid:15) ) | ) layers are needed for an (cid:15) -accurate solution to the inverse problem. Here we provide statements of theorems from the main text, proofs of theorems, detailed explanations of the experimental setup and further numerical examples. We brie\ufb02y collect some basic notation, and further notation will be introduced throughout where appropriate. We use N m,N to denote the class of neural networks (NNs) from C m to C N (see \u00a71.1.2.1 for the precise de\ufb01nition). Given a metric space ( M , d ) , x \u2208 M and X \u2282 M , d ( x, X ) = dist( x, X ) = inf y \u2208 X d ( x, y ) . For a matrix A \u2208 C m \u00d7 N , the norm k A k refers to the operator norm of A when C m and C N are equipped with the standard l 2 -norm. For x \u2208 C N and p \u2208 [1 , \u221e ] , k x k l p refers to the l p -norm of x . For a set of indices S and vector x , x S is the vector de\ufb01ned by ( x S ) j = x j if j \u2208 S and ( x S ) j = 0 if j / \u2208 S . Complex rationals Q + i Q are denoted by Q [ i ] . We use (cid:3) to denote the end of a proof and (cid:2) to denote the end of a remark.", "venue": "ArXiv", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 168, "citationCount": 37, "influentialCitationCount": 4, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Mathematics", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-01-20", "journal": {"volume": "abs/2101.08286", "name": "ArXiv"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "72167909", "name": "Vegard Antun"}, {"authorId": "51445731", "name": "Matthew J.

Genetic algorithms seem relevant in this field for many reasons. For instance, they lack the necessity to assume a certain statistical distribution, and they are efficient in dealing with non-stationary data. Indeed, the latter case is very frequent while forecasting the commodity prices of, for example, crude oil. Moreover, growing interest in their application has been observed recently. In parallel, researchers are also interested in constructing hybrid genetic algorithms (i.e., joining them with other econometric methods). Such an approach helps to reduce each of the individual method flaws and yields promising results. In this article, three groups of commodities are discussed: energy commodities, metals, and agricultural products. The advantages and disadvantages of genetic algorithms and their hybrids are presented, and further conclusions concerning their possible improvements and other future applications are discussed. This article fills a significant literature gap, focusing on particular financial and economic applications.

Predictive policing and risk assessment are salient examples. Worries include the accuracy of forecasts that guide both activities, the prospect of bias, and an apparent lack of operational transparency. Nearly breathless media coverage of artificial intelligence helps shape the narrative. In this review, we address these issues by first unpacking depictions of artificial intelligence. Its use in predictive policing to forecast crimes in time and space is largely an exercise in spatial statistics that in principle can make policing more effective and more surgical. Its use in criminal justice risk assessment to forecast who will commit crimes is largely an exercise in adaptive, nonparametric regression. It can in principle allow law enforcement agencies to better provide for public safety with the least restrictive means necessary, which can mean far less use of incarceration. None of this is mysterious. Nevertheless, concerns about accuracy, fairness, and transparency are real, and there are tradeoffs between them for which there can be no technical fix.

This paper provides a systematic literature review of the current state of affairs as well as future trends and aims to support stakeholders' decision-making in logistics management in the era of disruptive technologies. Design/methodology/approach - Several recent and representative articles from academic, industrial and governmental perspectives were investigated to set the scene for this research and to serve as a baseline for electing nine emerging technologies, which were then used to conduct a systematic literature review covering the literature within the area during the past twelve years. Findings - 3D printing, artificial intelligence, automated robots, autonomous vehicles, big data analytics, blockchain, drones, electric vehicles and the Internet of Things were identified as the emerging technologies. The current state of existing research and potential future opportunities were analyzed. Research limitations/implications - Since the potential literature body is almost impossible to fully cover, a tradeoff between the number of emerging technologies and the related literature reviewed has been performed. However, the paper provides a novel approach to select the emerging and disruptive technologies and a systematic literature review to fill the identified research gap in the related literature. Practical implications -The research support various stakeholders to better capture the current status of and the future opportunities in freight transportation and gain a clearer understanding of the disruptive technologies as well as to guide them in how to deploy these initiatives in future decision-making.

It therefore is crucial to understand how individuals perceive interaction with CAs and how the personality of both the CA and the human can affect the interaction experience. As personality differences are manifested in language cues, we investigate whether different language style manifestations of extraversion lead to a more anthropomorphized perception (specifically perceived humanness and social presence) of the personality bots. We examine, whether individuals rate communication satisfaction of a CA similar to their own personality as higher (law of attraction). The results of our experiment indicate that highly extraverted CAs are generally better received in terms of social presence and communication satisfaction. Further, incorporating personality into CAs increases perceived humanness. Although no significant effects could be found in regard to the law of attraction, interesting findings about ambiverts could be made.

Significant progress has been made in recent years to improve quality, promote patient safety, and increase value and cost-effectiveness in surgical care. Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) initiatives are increasing in popularity, improving outcomes, and enriching patient satisfaction. First developed for abdominal surgical cases, ERAS has increasingly established itself across all surgical subspecialities, including cardiac surgery. ERAS focuses on evidence-based initiatives in the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative phases of care to promote patient well-being and efficient care. The deliberate, judicious incorporation of technology into surgery and the periprocedural home has tremendous, revolutionary potential in all phases of care and is consistent with ERAS principles. This technology can be harnessed by physicians and the care provider team, the healthcare system, and perhaps most importantly, by patients themselves to lead to a higher level of engagement. We will explore technology's transformational capability by concentrating on cardiac surgery because of its prevalence, costs, risks, and contribution to the healthcare system's bottom line. In addition, the role that ERAS combined with technology can play in a constructive manner will be important. We discuss the disruptive effect that the COVID-19 pandemic offers to accelerate these developments. While the human cost of the pandemic has been staggering, in the post-COVID world, the lessons learned can be vital. Finally, we seek to show that the opportunities technology provides are closely related to what both patients and the physician and provider teams want. As technology inevitably becomes more integrated into healthcare, the ability to harness technology to maximize patient outcomes and well-being while promoting more efficient healthcare delivery will be critical. \u00a9 Journal of Hospital Management and Health Policy.

MANNs have shown promising results in question answering (QA) tasks that require holding contexts for answering a given question. As demands for QA on edge devices have increased, the utilization of MANNs in resource-constrained environments has become important. To achieve fast and energy-efficient inference of MANNs, we can exploit application-specific hardware accelerators on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Although several accelerators for conventional deep neural networks have been designed, it is difficult to efficiently utilize the accelerators with MANNs due to different requirements. In addition, characteristics of QA tasks should be considered for further improving the efficiency of inference on the accelerators. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose an inference accelerator of MANNs on FPGA. To fully utilize the proposed accelerator, we introduce fast inference methods considering the features of QA tasks. To evaluate our proposed approach, we implemented the proposed architecture on an FPGA and measured the execution time and energy consumption for the bAbI data set. According to our thorough experiments, the proposed methods improved speed and energy efficiency of the inference of MANNs up to about 25.6 and 28.4 times, respectively, compared with those of CPU.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 44, "citationCount": 4, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-01-01", "journal": {"volume": "29", "pages": "162-175", "name": "IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2267522", "name": "Seongsik Park"}, {"authorId": "2109766425", "name": "Jaehee Jang"}, {"authorId": "153274617", "name": "Seijoon Kim"}, {"authorId": "2972978", "name": "Byunggook Na"}, {"authorId": "2999019", "name": "Sungroh Yoon"}]}, {"paperId": "221be7ac383f4ef8de8e3bc4e5f2026b5ad0c80b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3091327592", "DOI": "10.1364/JOCN.401568", "CorpusId": 222136295}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/221be7ac383f4ef8de8e3bc4e5f2026b5ad0c80b", "title": "On the suitability, requisites, and challenges of machine learning [Invited]", "abstract": "The introduction of 5G, the increasing number of connected devices, and the exponential growth of services relying on connectivity are pressuring multilayer networks to improve their scaling, efficiency, and controlling capabilities.

We delineate aims and limitations while providing hands-on-advice utilizing concrete practical examples. Distinguishing between unintentionally and intentionally triggered AI risks with diverse socio-psycho-technological impacts, we exemplify a retrospective descriptive analysis followed by a retrospective counterfactual risk analysis. Building on these AI observatory tools, we present near-term transdisciplinary guidelines for AI safety. As further contribution, we discuss differentiated and tailored long-term directions through the lens of two disparate modern AI safety paradigms. For simplicity, we refer to these two different paradigms with the terms artificial stupidity (AS) and eternal creativity (EC) respectively. While both AS and EC acknowledge the need for a hybrid cognitive-affective approach to AI safety and overlap with regard to many short-term considerations, they differ fundamentally in the nature of multiple envisaged long-term solution patterns.

We then point out that the core issue in FSL is that the empirical risk minimizer is unreliable. Based on how prior knowledge can be used to handle this core issue, we categorize FSL methods from three perspectives: (i) data, which uses prior knowledge to augment the supervised experience; (ii) model, which uses prior knowledge to reduce the size of the hypothesis space; and (iii) algorithm, which uses prior knowledge to alter the search for the best hypothesis in the given hypothesis space. With this taxonomy, we review and discuss the pros and cons of each category.

At the forefront of this debate is Integrated Information Theory (IIT), widely regarded as the preeminent theory of consciousness because it quantified subjective experience in a scalar mathematical measure called \u03a6 that is in principle measurable. Epistemological issues in the form of the \u201cunfolding argument\u201d have provided a concrete refutation of IIT by demonstrating how it permits functionally identical systems to have differences in their predicted consciousness. The implication is that IIT and any other proposed theory based on a physical system\u2019s causal structure may already be falsified even in the absence of experimental refutation. However, so far many of these arguments surrounding the epistemological foundations of falsification arguments, such as the unfolding argument, are too abstract to determine the full scope of their implications. Here, we make these abstract arguments concrete, by providing a simple example of functionally equivalent machines realizable with table-top electronics that take the form of isomorphic digital circuits with and without feedback. This allows us to explicitly demonstrate the different levels of abstraction at which a theory of consciousness can be assessed. Within this computational hierarchy, we show how IIT is simultaneously falsified at the finite-state automaton level and unfalsifiable at the combinatorial-state automaton level. We use this example to illustrate a more general set of falsification criteria for theories of consciousness: to avoid being already falsified, or conversely unfalsifiable, scientific theories of consciousness must be invariant with respect to changes that leave the inference procedure fixed at a particular level in a computational hierarchy.", "venue": "Neuroscience of consciousness", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 45, "citationCount": 2, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics", "Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Mathematics", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Philosophy", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-06-12", "journal": {"volume": "2021", "name": "Neuroscience of Consciousness"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "69873213", "name": "J.

This exponential growth in advertising revenue has motivated fraudsters to exploit the weaknesses of the online advertising model to make money, and researchers to discover new security vulnerabilities in the model, to propose countermeasures and to forecast future trends in research. Motivated by these considerations, this paper presents a comprehensive review of the security threats to online advertising systems. We begin by introducing the motivation for online advertising system, explain how it differs from traditional advertising networks, introduce terminology, and define the current online advertising architecture. We then devise a comprehensive taxonomy of attacks on online advertising to raise awareness among researchers about the vulnerabilities of online advertising ecosystem. We discuss the limitations and effectiveness of the countermeasures that have been developed to secure entities in the advertising ecosystem against these attacks.

However, here we show that falsification is especially problematic for theories of consciousness. We formally describe the standard experimental setup for testing these theories. Based on a theory\u2019s application to some physical system, such as the brain, testing requires comparing a theory\u2019s predicted experience (given some internal observables of the system like brain imaging data) with an inferred experience (using report or behavior). If there is a mismatch between inference and prediction, a theory is falsified. We show that if inference and prediction are independent, it follows that any minimally informative theory of consciousness is automatically falsified. This is deeply problematic since the field\u2019s reliance on report or behavior to infer conscious experiences implies such independence, so this fragility affects many contemporary theories of consciousness.

In OR we aspire to be logical, and therefore our behaviours should be relatively easy to replicate in logic, the basis of computer systems.

To think about the issues, we can turn to our experience of practicing OR and to the insights of mathematics, philosophy, sociology, and economics. Mathematicians and philosophers have widened the scope of logic to cover many aspects of decision-making; sociologists have conducted research into the social context and consequences of new technologies and economists have analysed their rates of penetration. Some OR jobs will be destroyed and others will be created giving rise to new, more varied career paths.

In order to get a systematic picture, a taxonomy is developed that is based on the coordinates of formal versus material analogies and theory-guided versus pre-theoretic models in science. These distinctions have parallels in the computational versus mimetic aspects and in analytic versus exploratory types of computer simulation. The proposed taxonomy cuts across the traditional dichotomies between symbolic and embodied AI, general intelligence and symbol and intelligence and cognitive simulation and human/non-human-like AI. According to the taxonomy proposed here, one can distinguish between four distinct general approaches that figured prominently in early and classical AI, and that have partly developed into distinct research programs: first, phenomenal simulations (e.g., Turing\u2019s \u201cimitation game\u201d); second, simulations that explore general-level formal isomorphisms in pursuit of a general theory of intelligence (e.g., logic-based AI); third, simulations as exploratory material models that serve to develop theoretical accounts of cognitive processes (e.g., Marr\u2019s stages of visual processing and classical connectionism); and fourth, simulations as strictly formal models of a theory of computation that postulates cognitive processes to be isomorphic with computational processes (strong symbolic AI). In continuation of pragmatic views of the modes of modeling and simulating world affairs, this taxonomy of approaches to modeling in AI helps to elucidate how available computational concepts and simulational resources contribute to the modes of representation and theory development in AI research\u2014and what made that research program uniquely dependent on them.", "venue": "Perspectives on Science", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 99, "citationCount": 1, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2019-08-05", "journal": {"volume": "29", "pages": "409-435", "name": "Perspectives on Science"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "22851126", "name": "Hajo Greif"}]}, {"paperId": "9cb7e69d77e0772bba022016033851f619a02a82", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2946798032", "DOI": "10.1007/s13347-021-00454-7", "CorpusId": 181907131}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9cb7e69d77e0772bba022016033851f619a02a82", "title": "Group Agency and Artificial Intelligence", "abstract": null, "venue": "Philosophy & Technology", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 84, "citationCount": 11, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Sociology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Philosophy", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2019-05-16", "journal": {"name": "Philosophy & Technology"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "144451484", "name": "C.

In this new marketplace, while consumers interact with AI, they gain new experiences and feel positive or negative because of these experiences. Also, they build different relationships with AI, such as servant, master, or partner.

In a majority of the learning algorithms used in industrial as well as academic settings, the firstorder iterative optimization procedure Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), is the backbone. However, SGD is often time-consuming, as it typically requires several passes through the entire dataset in order to converge to a solution of sufficient quality. In order to cope with increasing data volumes, and to facilitate accelerated processing utilizing contemporary hardware, various parallel SGD variants have been proposed. In addition to traditional synchronous parallelization schemes, asynchronous ones have received particular interest in recent literature due to their improved ability to scale due to less coordination, and subsequently waiting time. However, asynchrony implies inherent challenges in understanding the execution of the algorithm and its convergence properties, due the presence of both stale and inconsistent views of the shared state. In this work, we aim to increase the understanding of the convergence properties of SGD for practical applications under asynchronous parallelism, and develop tools and frameworks that facilitate improved convergence properties as well as further research and development. First, we focus on understanding the impact of staleness, and introduce models for capturing the dynamics of parallel execution of SGD. This enables (i) quantifying the statistical penalty on the convergence due to staleness and (ii) deriving an adaptation scheme, introducing a staleness-adaptive SGD variant MindTheStep-AsyncSGD , which provably reduces this penalty. Second, we aim at exploring the impact of synchronization mechanisms, in particular consistency-preserving ones, and the overall effect on the convergence properties. To this end, we propose LeashedSGD , an extensible algorithmic framework supporting various synchronization mechanisms for different degrees of consistency, enabling in particular a lockfree and consistency-preserving implementation. In addition, the algorithmic construction of Leashed-SGD enables dynamic memory allocation, claiming memory only when necessary, which reduces the overall memory footprint. We perform an extensive empirical study, benchmarking the proposed methods, together with established baselines, focusing on the prominent application of Deep Learning for image classification on the benchmark datasets MNIST and CIFAR, showing significant improvements in converge time for Leashed-SGD and MindTheStep-AsyncSGD .", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 70, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "72573425", "name": "Karl B\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m"}]}, {"paperId": "39a30b18bb2a6d2b06e7eeae22e8d1e476be48ae", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 249270146}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/39a30b18bb2a6d2b06e7eeae22e8d1e476be48ae", "title": "Artificial Intelligence Reframing Thinking Machines Within the History of Media and Communication", "abstract": ": Beginning with a critical exploration of the canonical histories of AI, this chapter stresses how the history of communication and media research may contribute to existing historiographies of AI. Four key aspects of the long-standing relationship between communication, media, and AI are discussed: the cross-history of communication theory (especially cybernetics) and AI, the early development of AI and human-computer interaction, the relevance of media and science fiction narratives in AI research and imaginaries, and the role of games in shaping interaction with AI software as communication between humans and machines. Rely-ing on an historical and critical discussion of these four aspects, we claim that reconsidering the history of AI does not only contribute to the historiography of the field but adds more ground for rethinking and discussing the theoretical foun-dations of communication and media studies at large. we have discussed here only work concerned with more or less self-contained problem solving programs.

Queneau\u2019s original printed version of Cent mille milliards de po\u00e8mes ( CMMP ) was conceived as a \u201cmachine\u201d that allows readers to potentially create a hundred thousand billion poems (almost all perfect sonnets) by combining 140 verses printed on movable strips of paper. Queneau described his book as a \u201c machine \u00e0 fabriquer des po\u00e8mes \u201d. Immediately after its publication in 1961, computer scientists interested in poetry and poets interested in computing began to port the book to computers. In this presentation, I investigate the different potential meanings of the word \u201cmachine\u201d in the context of the adaptation of Queneau\u2019s books into computer programs. The word \u201cmachine\u201d, when used by Queneau in the preface of CMMP , is to be read more as an instrument than an automaton. Queneau\u2019s instructional manual clearly encourages all readers to compose their own poems at will. By empowering the reader with a configurative function, Queneau aimed at fulfilling Lautr\u00e9amont\u2019s program: \u201cpoetry must be made by all, not by one\u201d (1961, II).

In the future, machines can carry out intelligence-requiring tasks, which previously were done by people. It is thus good to develop methodologies for designing intelligent systems. An example of such methods is cognitive mimetics, i.e. imitating human information processing. Today, machines cannot by themselves navigate in archipelagos. However, the fact that people can take care of ship steering and navigation means that there is an information process, which makes it possible to navigate ships. This information process takes place inside the minds of navigating people. If we are able to explicate the information processing in the navigator\u2019s mind, the knowledge of it can be used in designing intelligent machines. Replicating physical objects and industrial processes by means of digital computers is called digital twinning. Digital twins (DTs), which are digital replicas of physical systems and processes, have recently become tools for working with complex industrial processes. A crucial question for DTs is should human actions be added to them? As the answer is positive, such models of human information processing can be called human digital twins (HDTs). The knowledge of human tacit and explicit information processes can be represented by human digital twins. Models can be used in the search for a deeper understanding of human intelligent information processes. Human digital twins can thus be used as methodological tools in cognitive mimetics. In our present study, we modeled paper machine operators\u2019 thinking. Specifically, we developed an ideal-exception-correction (IEC) model for paper operators\u2019 control logic. The model illustrates how research and HDT-modeling can be used for explicating the subconscious or tacit information processing of people for the design of intelligent systems.

In recent years, there has been a need to study the artificial intelligence use for the operation of restaurants, as in Ukraine (and in most countries) there is no such experience. The use of artificial intelligence systems customer-to-customer and item-to-item will ensure the quality of food delivery sites, which will allow you to analyze the order of the guest and identify the patterns of his preferences thus, automatically ask him to choose a certain set, dish and successful additions to the order, which will increase the average check, or choose new establishments that will help them enter the market of restaurant services.\nPurpose and methods. The purpose of the study is to analyze the current state, determine the prospects for the application of existing robotic technologies in the technological process of restaurants and develop a robotization scheme of the technological process of restaurants such as salad bar. Methods are in the course of research the methods of logical generalization concerning development of the robotization scheme of technological process which were carried out by means of the computer ArchiCaD program were applied.\nResults. The problem of introduction and the artificial intelligence use are studied by scientists and researchers in various fields of science. Considering their scientific works, it can be noted that artificial intelligence is already actively used for the manufacture of culinary products in foreign restaurants. There are known examples of the use of barista robots, pizza robots, salad maker robots, burger maker robots, etc. The study developed the robotization scheme of the technological process of salad bar, consisting of three stages. The first stage is the service of visitors in the shopping area, where the selection of the order, payment through the terminal and the subsequent automatic receipt of culinary products and beverages. The second stage is the preparation of semi-finished products in the procurement area. This process is controlled by a chef-operator, who controls the required number of semi-finished products and cleans and cuts vegetables, fruits, meat and fish products using machines for cleaning and slicing culinary products. The program provides for the analysis of the balance and the required number of semi-finished products and the choice of components for the preparation of salads with artificial intelligence. The third stage is the automatic preparation of salad in the pre-cooking production area. The artificial intelligence placed in the system analyzes the guest\u2019s order and activates the containers with the necessary ingredients, mixes them and unloads them into a container covered with a plastic lid, and the robot stamping element leaves the order number on the lid. The proposed scheme provides for compliance with sanitary and hygienic standards for institutions of this type. With the developed system of production activities, the required number of employees will be 5 people: cleaner in the trade area, dishwasher, tray packer, cook-operator of the pre-cooking area and system administrator of artificial intelligence.\nConclusions and discussions. The authors analyze the current state, identify prospects for the application of existing robotic technologies in the technological process of restaurants and developed a robotization scheme of the technological process on the example of a salad bar. The developed scheme consists of three stages: service of visitors, preparation of semi-finished products and automatic preparation of finished goods.

This philosophical paper examines the Darwinian account of creativity as a model for assessing computational creativity. It will first establish a Darwinian account of creativity using Simonton\u2019s [1] model. It will then apply this model to popular image-producing AI, Generative Adversarial Networks, and the promising Creative Adversarial Network, both used in the computational production of \u2018artworks\u2019. The paper will argue that these networks are compatible with a Darwinian account of creativity, due to the presence of blind variation within the networks, a key component of Simonton\u2019s model. The paper will then address some initial objections. The aim of this paper will ultimately be to assess whether the AI systems are compatible with the Darwinian model of creativity, and in the process explore Darwinian creativity as a potential standard for testing computational creativity. 12 Abstract. The purpose of this ongoing research is to better understand the potential contributions that computers can play in situations where people interact with computers towards creative pur-suits and goals. Past research has provided sets of de\ufb01nitions of different roles that a computer plays in human-computer creative collaboration. Thus far, we look into the advantages and limitations of having such roles. In particular, this paper contributes an analysis and categorisation of the coverage of existing role classi\ufb01cations for computational participants in co-creativity. This analysis is comple-mented by a comparative review of the use of roles to understand and structure creative collaboration between people only (i.e. without any computational participants involved). Our wider project investigates whether these de\ufb01ned sets of roles are a. adequate and b. helpful for understanding the perception of computational contributions in co-creativity, with a study planned to investigate the roles of current systems in practice. This project considers both co-creative computer systems that currently exist, and systems that could potentially exist in the future. Our goal is to reach a point where the perception of what is possible in human-computer co-creative collaboration is enabled and boosted (but not constrained) by a de\ufb01nitive set of roles. Abstract. This paper argues that a too-expansive view on creativity is unhelpful at best and deeply misleading at worst. As with \u201crepresentation\u201d, the word \u201ccreativity\u201d comes value-laden in ways that researchers cannot lightly get away from, if they can escape at all; simply claiming that one is using the word in a technical sense is not a solution. Neither should one take an overly narrow view that takes advantage of a priori arguments to deny creativity to classes of agents or putative agents solely by their membership in those classes. The paper proceeds by o\ufb00ering a de\ufb01nition of creativity meant to prejudice neither human being nor artefact; then setting out the conditions for a putative creative agent to be a creative agent, concluding that no existing artefactual agents appear to fall into this category; \ufb01nally, addressing the question of why computers, computer programs, robots, and related artefacts have nevertheless had a profound \u2013 indeed, transformational \u2013 e\ufb00ect on human creativity, taking creativity to places that neither human beings nor artefacts could have gone on their own. It ends with a discussion of the person I see as one of the key early voices on computational creativity. Abstract. We present AMI \u2013 Arti\ufb01cial Music Intelligence, a deep neural network that can generate musical compositions of different instruments with a coherent long-term structure. AMI uses a state-of-the-art general-purpose deep neural network architecture, called the Transformer model [7], to discover patterns of musical structures such as melodies, chords, and rhythm, from tens of thousands of MIDI \ufb01les. The learning is done in an unsupervised manner, allowing exploitation of large collections of MIDI \ufb01les that are available on the internet. We trained AMI over 8000 classical music MIDI \ufb01les. As an autoregressive model, AMI predicts a music note at a time depending on not just the last note, but a long sequence of notes (up to thousands) from previous time steps. The previous notes are not provided via some hidden state such as in a recurrent neural network (RNN), instead the model has direct access to all earlier notes. Furthermore, we enhance the learning of musical structures by adding different kinds of embeddings: one short-term embedding and one long-term embedding. As a result, the model is able to maintain a coherent long-term structure and occasionally pick up different movements. Audio examples of the model output can be heard at https://meddis.dcs.shef.ac.uk/melody/samples . The Transformer model is the latest advance in language understanding [6, 2, 1], which is trained to predict the next token in a sequence of text. The core idea behind the model is self-attention \u2013 the ability to attend to different positions of the sequence to compute a representation of that sequence. It allows the modelling of a much longer sequence than one that can be modelled by previous language models such as a recurrent neural network based model. This makes the model well-suited for modelling music data, whose structure and meaning are often built by repetition and self-reference on multiple timescales.Unlikeone-dimensional multiple Abstract. We present a system design for applying functional models of improvisational music to the generation of game soundtracks that react to game events. We provide a proof-of-concept implementation using Unity/C# and Haskell to create an interactive scene where the music changes as the user interacts with creatures in the environment. Abstract.

In recent years, researchers are trying to apply AI techniques in various stages of software development to improve the overall quality of software products. Moreover, there are also some researchers who focus on the intersection between software engineering and AI. In fact, the relationship between software engineering and AI is very weak; however, methods and techniques in one area have been adopted in another area. More and more software products are capable of performing intelligent behavior like human beings. In this research project, two cases studies which are IBM Watson and Google AlphaGo that use different AI techniques in solving real-world challenging problems have been analyzed, evaluated and compared. Based on the analysis of both case studies, using AI techniques such as deep learning and machine learning in software systems contributes to intelligent systems. Watson adopts \u2019decision making support\u2019 strategy to help humans make decisions; whereas AlphaGo uses \u2019self-decision making\u2019 to choose operations that contribute to the best outcome. In addition, Watson learns from man-made resources such as paper; AlphaGo, on the other hand, learns from massive online resources such as photos. AlphaGo uses neural networks and reinforcement learning to mimic human brain, which might be very useful in medical research for diagnosis and treatment. However, there is still a long way to go if we want to reproduce human brain in machine and view computers as thinkers, because human brain and machines are intrinsically different.

However, this paper raises a rarely reported stage in such experiments called Post-Selection alter the reader to several possible protocol flaws that may result in misleading results. All AI methods fall into two broad schools, connectionist and symbolic. The Post-Selection fall into two kinds, Post-Selection Using Validation Sets (PSUVS) and Post-Selection Using Test Sets (PSUTS). Each kind has two types of post-selectors, machines and humans. The connectionist school received criticisms for its \u201cblack box\u201d and now the Post-Selection; but the seemingly \u201cclean\u201d symbolic school seems more brittle because of its human PSUTS.

Abstract We propose an effective, innovative framework for developing content for design activities that address the challenges of the future where emerging technologies play a central role. Although engineering education research is concerned with preparing future engineers, the integration of future trends in technology with the engineering curriculum has been limited. We propose the Design the Future Activities (DFA) as a framework for systematically identifying and integrating emerging areas of research and technologies, such as artificial intelligence, into the teaching of engineering design. The core of developing and delivering the DFA framework is the teaching of the technology of artificial intelligence (AI). Because these technologies will change the nature of the future, we seek to engage with the ongoing discourse on the relationship between content (for design education) and pedagogy, through a proposed pedagogical content knowledge conceptual framework. Through a scholarship of integration that breaks the boundaries between disciplines, we propose a three-level framework: (1) Understanding technology analysis and system integration (to allow students to identify appropriate solutions given new technologies); (2) Making a value chain (or how these are appropriate solutions); and (3) Developing responsible innovations (or why these are appropriate solutions). While engineers continue to be creators and influencers of such technologies, the lack of understanding of the impact of their own technologies continues to cause an imbalanced innovation landscape, in education and in the workplace. We conclude that a new design approach to the engineering curriculum should be attempted, assuming that educators will systematically anticipate the future and recalibrate the curriculum. the special amalgam of content and pedagogy as conceptualized in the PCK framework.

While their use can provide substantial benefits, they also entail significant risks \u2013 and ethics has been put forward as the key solution to counter these risks. Yet the manner in which ethics is typically relied on in this context is woefully deficient. At best, ethics is given the role of orienting problematic technology towards \u2018acceptable\u2019 uses, thereby legitimizing AI\u2019s widespread adoption, which is taken for granted. At worst, ethics is instrumentalized as a quality-label to stimulate AI\u2019s deployment, as part of a broader doctrine of \u2018progress\u2019. Current ethics discourse hence appears unable to provide a more fundamental critique of the way in which the algorithmized world is profoundly impacting our existence. This is because it starts from within a technological paradigm that does not fundamentally question AI\u2019s place and progression in society. In this paper, I therefore argue that, if ethics is to shed light on \u2013 and to offer a more fundamental critique of \u2013 the human condition in an algorithmized world, without being bound to today\u2019s technological paradigm, it requires a meta-technological perspective that puts ethics first. To pursue this aim, I propose to ground our approach in the fact that our existence in the world is necessarily intersubjective and relational, and use the lens of intersubjectivity to examine AI\u2019s impact on the human condition. To narrow the scope of my analysis, I focus on AI\u2019s impact on three interrelated domains of our existence: (1) our way of thinking or rationality, (2) our way of engaging with others or alterity and (3) our way of experiencing time or history. In my analysis, I draw on the work of 20th-century Jewish thinkers, such as Franz Rosenzweig, Emmanuel Levinas and Hannah Arendt, given the importance they ascribe to relationality and its role in countering totalitarian thinking which, as I argue, can also arise through the systemic irresponsible use of AI. After introducing my research inquiry (Chapter 1) and providing a brief definition of AI (Chapter 2), I seek to answer three questions: First, what does the algorithmized world look like, and what is its underpinning societal paradigm (Chapter 3)? Second, how does current AI ethics discourse approach AI\u2019s risks, and how does it fall short of delivering a more fundamental critique of AI\u2019s impact on the human condition (Chapter 4)? Third, how does AI\u2019s ubiquity affect the human condition, and particularly our experience of rationality, alterity and history (Chapter 5)? Based on my research findings, I conclude that the totalizing use of AI systems \u2013 and the way it impacts our way of thinking, our way of engaging with others and our way of experiencing time \u2013 can give rise to significant concerns, as it may be used in a way that opposes our ability to live a meaningful life by engaging in intersubjective human relationships.

Most myths contain some germ of truth but this one is exceptional in that it is more or less completely false. In fact AI is a remarkably successful research program which has delivered not only scientific insight but a great deal of useful technology. One of the main reasons why people assert the failure of AI as a research program is the mistaken view that its main goal is to replicate human intelligence. Such a view is understandable. It is common to misread Turing\u2019s 1950 paper Computing Machinery and Intelligence as suggesting that the ultimate goal of AI should be the complete replication of human intelligence. AI researchers have also not done sufficient to make it clear that complete replication of human intelligence is not the ultimate goal of AI. A further source of the failure myth is the need felt by many researchers to distance their approach to AI from other, usually previous, approaches. In many cases a fashionable approach to AI may give itself a new name ALife would be a good example \u2013 and portray previous AI approaches as having failed. In truth there is no failure to be explained. Almost every citizen in the developed world makes use of AIderived technology every day. The fact that this AI technology is usually hidden in other technologies and works unobtrusively is a measure of just how successful AI has been.

Animal Sentience 13(8)", "abstract": "Evolutionarily conserved features have been demonstrated at many levels of biological organization across a variety of species. Evolutionary conservation may apply to complex behavioral phenomena too. It is thus not inconceivable that a form of sentience does exist even in the lowest order vertebrate taxon, the teleosts. How similar it is to human sentience in its level of complexity or in its multidimensional features is a difficult question, especially from an experimental standpoint, given that even the definition of human sentience is debated. Woodruff attempts a Turing-like test of fish sentience, and lists numerous neuroanatomic, neurophysiological and behavioral similarities between fish and humans. In this commentary, I add to these similarities by discussing empirical findings showing complex forms of mental representation in fish. At the same time, I note that without a more thorough understanding of human sentience and more data on similarities as well as differences between fish and mammals, the final conclusion may have to wait. Robert Gerlai, Professor of Psychology, University of Toronto, does research on neurobiological and genetic mechanisms of behavior in fish and rodents. He is Fellow and past president of the International Behavioral Neuroscience Society. He received the Distinguished Scientist Award from the International Behavioral and Neural Genetics Society in 2013, and the University of Toronto Mississauga Excellence in Research Award in 2015. sites.utoronto.ca/GerlaiLab/ 1. Evolutionary conservation at many levels of biology: Does it extend to sentience? Evolutionary biology has taught us that all species are related to each other. The question is only the degree of relatedness. We also know that evolution is a process whereby random genetic changes leading to alterations in previously existing phenotypes are tested in terms of how they increase or decrease the ability to reproduce under current environmental conditions. In other words, evolution is not a designer that creates things from scratch. Biologists find evolutionary homologies across a broad range of features and across a large number of species from fish to human. Steps of embryonic development, fundamental anatomical layout of brains, neurotransmitter systems and their receptors, molecular mechanisms of neuronal plasticity, and amino acid sequences of proteins all exhibit homologies, which are signs of common ancestry. Why should sentience be different? I would argue, therefore, that the question is not whether fish are sentient, but rather to what degree and in what flavor? In other words, where Animal Sentience 2017.045: Gerlai on Woodruff on Fish Feel 2 do we draw the line? Or more provocatively, is there a line to draw at all? Clearly, human sentience is a species-typical feature of Homo sapiens. Fish do not have it. But does this prove that we are the only sentient creature walking (flying, swimming, crawling) on this planet? Woodruff\u2019s (2017) target article makes a genuine effort to show us that it does not! 2. Where do we draw the line? A Turing test for fish. According to Woodruff, fish do exhibit signs of sentience, a conclusion that depends upon how we define the phenomenon and associated underlying mechanisms. And there lies the biggest question: the definition of the phenomenon. We all think we know what it is to be aware, or to be sentient or conscious. But does science really know the answer to these questions? Woodruff attempts to answer by focusing on empirical, experimental definitions: mechanisms and behavioral responses, a Turing test (Turing, 1950) of sentience for fish. He shows us that fish do indeed possess features at the levels of anatomy, neurophysiology and behavior compatible with the assumption of the presence of sentience. The similarities he cites across human and fish features abound. But so do the differences (Bay\u00e9s et al., 2017)! Which should we emphasize? And which represent proof or disproof? My own impression is that these questions are still to be discussed, and the answers will continue to be refined and re-discussed again and again. But let me add another angle to this discussion, leading back to the question of how we define sentience. To me, it appears this phenomenon has to do with modeling the external world. Mental representations of the outside allow the organism to remember the past, understand the present, and forecast the future, a phenomenon that in humans, and in some other mammals as well as some bird species, scientists call the ability to do \u201cmental time travel\u201d (Clayton, 2015). Mental representations imply that there is an actor, the self, that experiences, and plays a role in, the representation. Sentience may be an epiphenomenon, an emergent property of increasingly sophisticated mental representations afforded by complex brains. Setting aside questions about specific anatomy, connectome, electrophysiology and molecular mechanisms, do we know whether fish brains are complex enough for mental representations to form? From the results of behavioral studies, the answer to this question is: yes, we already do. 3. Complex mental representations: What do fish learn and remember? I will give only two examples, from my own research. The ability to make numerical or quantity estimations is a human feature but it is also widespread in the animal kingdom (Feigenson et al., 2004). A variety of fish species have been shown to be able to tell more from less, and, surprisingly, the way they do it also resembles how human children do it (G\u00f3mez-Laplaza & Gerlai, 2016). Most recently, we have shown that a fish species, angelfish (Pterophyllum scalare), is not only capable of making the distinction between more and less when the item sets to be compared are present at the same time, but also when the items are not shown, i.e., when the fish have to remember where the items used to be (G\u00f3mez-Laplaza & Gerlai, 2016). In other words, we now have clear evidence of memory, i.e., mental representation of more vs. less in a fish species. Does this mean that fish \u201cunderstand\u201d the abstract meaning of more vs. less? are they \u201caware\u201d of their Animal Sentience 2017.045: Gerlai on Woodruff on Fish Feel 3 choices? No, it does not. But it does show a level of sophistication in their mental representation abilities that in the past was thought to be uniquely human. The other example of complex mental representation in fish comes from our studies on spatial learning in zebrafish. As also discussed by Woodruff, the hallmark of episodic or declarative memory is its relational aspect (Eichenbaum, 1992). The ability to organize and relate what seem to be loosely related bits and pieces of information is a fundamental requirement for us to be able to remember where, what and when things happened to us, a function supported by the hippocampal formation. Thus, tests of relational memory have been used to analyze \u201cdeclarative episodic\u201d memory in non-human animals too (Eichenbaum, 1992), species that cannot talk. A frequently employed relational type of hippocampal memory task is the spatial memory test in which mammals (mostly rodents) learn the dynamic representation of visual cues outside the maze. But how do we know what they actually learn? This is a complicated question that has been explored experimentally. A rodent with a disrupted hippocampus can pick out a single cue from the background, turning the spatial task into an elemental task that it can seemingly perform well (Gerlai, 1998; Phillips & LeDoux, 1994). However, if a salient associative cue is experimentally provided in addition to the spatial cues, hippocampally lesioned animals cannot pick out a secondary cue, and thus will \u201crecognize\u201d the location of the reinforcer only when the associative cue is presented. Hippocampally intact mammals, on the other hand, can learn both at the same time: the dynamic spatial map, and the salient cue. Thus, when faced with the spatial task, hippocampally intact rodents can identify the location of the reinforcer even in the absence of the salient associative cue (Gerlai, 1998; Phillips & LeDoux, 1994). Surprisingly, so can zebrafish (Karnik & Gerlai, 2014). In other words, zebrafish acquire spatial information the same way rodents with an intact hippocampus do, despite the fact that zebrafish lack the hippocampal structure specific to mammalian brains. The ability to acquire a complex spatial map suggests sophisticated mental representation in fish. Does it mean fish are sentient? No, it does not. But this second Turing test of mental representation previously thought to be a sole property of complex mammalian brains has now also been passed with flying colors by fish. In sum, Woodruff\u2019s arguments about the many similarities between fish and humans are eyeopening. But to truly understand what it feels like to be a fish, we may need to appreciate both the similarities and the differences between us and them. We may even need a better understanding of what it really feels like to be human.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 12, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "4809629", "name": "R.

We believe that modularization and multi-layered structures are among essential ingredients constituting creative minds and may greatly benefit machines on handling creative tasks. For proof of concept, we select musical composition, particularly, Species Counterpoint, as the task, adopt a recently proposed computational framework designed for investigating creativity and the creative process, and present an implementation capable of producing the outcomes that exhibit the desired effect. Introduction and Reflections Computing machinery has been fascinating to human beings for quite a long time. Accompanied with the introduction to the idea and design of a programmable, general-purpose, mechanical computer, well known as Babbage\u2019s Analytical Engine (Menabrea 1843), almost two centuries ago, expectations and speculations on the potentials, especially in aspects of intelligence and creativity, of such a machine had been boldly made by Lovelace (1843), \u201c..., the engine might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent.\u201d A century later, Turing (1950) asked the question, \u201cCan machines think?\u201d to address the intelligence aspect of machines and to argue that machines may eventually exhibit intelligent behavior as playing well in the imitation game. Now, we wish to ask the question, \u201cCan machines create?\u201d Under the current circumstances, we are unable to directly, appropriately answer this question. Instead, in this article, within the scope of musical composition, we would like to make a discussion on the apparent lack of certain essential components, capabilities, and properties that enable or permit machines to create in the present prevailing techniques. Moreover, we provide our preliminary implementation as a viable technical construction with its generated results indicating that the existence of some these essential ingredients brings machines one step further closer to being able to create. The most prominent, prevailing computational techniques in the related fields of artificial intelligence are undoubtedly the methods in the family of deep learning and artificial neural networks, and in the area of music generation, there have already been enormous studies and results (Briot, Hadjeres, and Pachet 2020). We do not intend to diminish the importance or undermine the practical value of those works, but if methods of this category are adopted, from the viewpoint of creators, or more specifically, music composers, in terms of the present form of the methodology, there are certain limitations in the aspects of formality, capability, and efficacy (Pearl and Mackenzie 2018). The technical framework of deep learning requires a huge amount of data, i.e., existing music pieces in this case, to train models which no matter will be used as classifiers or generators. Insufficient data will be unable to render useful or meaningful outcomes, let alone models that can create in the common sense. In history, there are only a few productive music composers creating certain amount of music pieces. Simply according to this situation, in contrast to the usage and requirements of the deep learning methodology, it can be seen that creativity and the action of creating may not properly fit with how deep learning operates and functions. As to the characteristics of deep learning, please allow us to make an arguable analogy. We know that any boolean function, as long as the truth table is given, in theory, we can directly construct its combinational circuits in a systematic way by analyzing and identifying the essential prime implicants. It is in the fundamentals of logic design. However, in practice, except for certain, usually extremely simple, circuits, most circuits are not designed in this way. Instead, their design process usually incorporates modularization, multi-layered structures, domain knowledge, and even personal experience of designers. Although the techniques of deep learning keeps evolving and advancing, employing popular deep learning techniques on music generation tasks is intrinsically similar to making attempts to piece together superficial elements, like prime implicants in the circuit case, to produce target outcome in the basic, primitive way. For music, such an approach in fact not only conceptually ignores the separate, usually totally different ideas and emotions that the music composer would like to convey and express via individual music pieces but also decontextualizes the music pieces by not considering the essence constitutes the creation such as the historical background, the cultural heritage, and even possibly the factors of instruments, including timbre, registers, and the difficulty to perform. Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Computational Creativity (ICCC \u201921) ISBN: 978-989-54160-3-5 400 Moreover, pre-existing knowledge, pre-determined settings, and personal preference or experience are extremely difficult to inject into the use of deep learning methods if at all possible. While the models obtained from deep learning can be presented in detail in the form of many parameters, usually millions, and easily duplicated for replicating the results, the operation as a whole fundamentally forms a black box. Thus, a successful, practically applicable artificial neural network model can provide little information for gaining insights or triggering inspiration. In recent years, while the research directions such as interpretable machine learning and explainable artificial intelligence have emerged (Linardatos, Papastefanopoulos, and Kotsiantis 2021), the advancement is currently quite limited. Therefore, in this article, we wish to respond to the call made by Turing for making machines intelligent, or in our case, capable of creating. We would like to take a small step towards making machines able or seemingly able to create in the common sense. In order to integrate the computational framework with the concept of modularization and the multi-layered structures of the creating process, we adopt our recently proposed meta-framework, ants on multiple graphs, AntsOMG (Chang and Chen 2020) and one of its showcase, the composition of organum motets (Chang and Chen 2021), in the hope that the essential ingredients in the creating process, especially in music composition, can be observed. Based on the design and properties of AntsOMG, we expect the presented implementation to possess certain characteristics, such as accessibility, scalability, and explainability. Moreover, at the level of technical details, since the implementation is multi-layered and modularized, the \u201ccomponents\u201d of the produced model for composing music can even be separated and swapped with ease. Hence, transfer learning, utilizing pre-existing knowledge, incorporating pre-determined settings, integrating human experience, and the like can be achieved. By conducting research along this line, hopefully injecting creativity into machines may someday be accomplished.", "venue": "ICCC", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 35, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"pages": "400-404"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "151504753", "name": "Chun-yien Chang"}, {"authorId": "101612255", "name": "Yingpeng Chen"}]}, {"paperId": "b8b764703a6ab0e0b01194a1d8be3a02a352f8b4", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 245121860}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b8b764703a6ab0e0b01194a1d8be3a02a352f8b4", "title": "1st Workshop on Automatic Spoken Language Translation in Real-World Settings", "abstract": "We address the problem of language model customization in applications where the ASR component needs to manage domain-specific terminology; although current state-of-the-art speech recognition technology provides excellent results for generic domains, the adaptation to specialized dictionaries or glossaries is still an open issue.

Finally, I argue that connectionist models capture the inde nite nature of higher-level abstractions, such as those that appear in natural language.

In this paper, we investigate the problem of target-guided knowledge-aware recommendation dialogue and design a dialogue generation system to alleviate the above-mentioned issues. Specifically, we employ pre-trained language models with multi-task learning to jointly learn response generation and goal prediction towards the target. We also present a knowledge-preserving encoding strategy to maintain the facts in background knowledge. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our system significantly outperforms various competitive models in terms of both automatic and manual evaluations.

Can artificial intelligence have a sense of humour? Is there a difference between human and machine laughter? Some machines already fulfil certain conditions which are associated with the human sense of humour: on the most superficial level machines appear to laugh and produce jokes, and they recognise sarcasm and punchlines, and they can evaluate funniness. In short, artificial intelligence is already able to recognise humour, and reacts to it accordingly. Furthermore, people laugh with humorous machines. However, it is still uncertain whether artificial intelligence can have a sense of humour or not, at least in comparison to a human sense of humour. To build bridges between AI research and philosophy of humour, this article proposes that there are (at least) five notable philosophical issues to be addressed if we are to accept that machines can have a (humanlike) sense of humour.

It is an invaluable tool in the analysis, aggregation, and simplification of free text. It has already demonstrated significant potential in the analysis of radiology reports. There are abundant open-source libraries and tools available that facilitate its application to the benefit of radiology. Radiologists who understand its limitations and potential will be better positioned to evaluate NLP models, understand how they can improve clinical workflow, and facilitate research endeavors involving large amounts of human language. The advent of increasingly affordable and powerful computer processing, the large quantities of medical and radiologic data, and advances in machine learning algorithms have contributed to the large potential of NLP. In turn, radiology has significant potential to benefit from the ability of NLP to convert relatively standardized radiology reports to machine-readable data. NLP benefits from standardized reporting, but because of its ability to interpret free text by using context clues, NLP does not necessarily depend on it. An overview and practical approach to NLP is featured, with specific emphasis on its applications to radiology. A brief history of NLP, the strengths and challenges inherent to its use, and freely available resources and tools are covered to guide further exploration and study within the field. Particular attention is devoted to the recent development of the Word2Vec and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) language models, which have exponentially increased the power and utility of NLP for a variety of applications.

The abstraction of physical systems, typical of digital computation (NAND/NOR, Multiply/Add, processors, algorithms), is possible for physical computing systems (e.g. [56]), although it requires understanding the core computational primitives of that substrate. These abstractions require formulating and modeling operational principles, implementation of these operational principles in a physical system, and addressing the technologies or devices being used. Conceptual Bridges between Physical Computing Techniques. While visualizing a physical computing solution might be clearer with one technique, application constraints might require a different embodiment of the solution. Bridges must be built between these approaches; the conceptual framework noted above for placing approaches can help build such bridges. One example is state superposition, a phenomenon present in all physical systems when using their linear operating region (e.g. optical, analog, quantum) [3], [8], [53]. Different encodings allow for different implementation approaches. A complex number could be encoded as two real-valued physical quantities, or it could be encoded as the magnitude and phase of a sinusoidal signal. Different representations may have better interfaces to physical sensors and may enable improved implementations. In every application, there are tons of practical details that need to be solved. Interfacing one physical system to another physical system or interfacing a physical system to an integer-based digital system requires multiple engineering details as well as transformations / approximations between the domains. Sometimes Noise can help Physical Computing. Nature teaches us that noise can be your friend. How does the cell that has incredibly noisy pico-Watt twoto three-bit precise analog variables, figure out when to divide and when not to, when to fight a virus, when to coordinate the immune system? It does that, because all the noisy analog variables collectively come up with one answer that matters. It is the final signal variable that matters, and not the intermediate signal variables that are noisy [4]\u2013[8], [10], [11], [53], [57]\u2013[60]. Noise can be your friend and it can be your enemy, and one needs both. For example, in [18], judicious addition of noise helps find better Ising minima, but too little or too much noise degrades results. Noise, or errors modeled as noise, will degrade the quality of a deterministic answer in any computation and can be the enemy of a designer. Several physical computing techniques are more robust to noise accumulation compared to digital systems, and yet accounting for noise is essential for all computations. Noise often enables unbiased search decisions for good solutions to energy surface minimizations. A particular problem must utilize all knowledge of the system to reduce the energy landscape. If one just uses noise, then the system is just performing a random walk in an exponential large space and will be lost forever. These noise fluctuations should be created at multiple scales in order to sample in space and time. If these kinds of fluctuations are fast compared to the dissipative processes that drive the adaptation of the system, then the system can rapidly sample a complex state and more slowly adapt itself. 6.3. Physical System Design requires an EDA Community Ecosystem 44 Phase and Amplitude. The RT discussed that there might be significant benefits in utilizing phase, and it was envisioned that future data-processing systems might be based on phase as much as on amplitude. Current informationprocessing systems are based on amplitude, and if one were to add phase to amplitude, one could build fundamentally more powerful devices. It appears that there is big room here for improvement here. Examples of already-demonstrated, practical systems based on phase include [17]\u2013[19], as already noted earlier. Perhaps most interestingly, by including phase one then can then utilize state superposition. It is commonly believed that basing computation on states with superposition is an attribute only for quantum computers, and one has to have quantum computers in order to gain the benefits of superposition for algorithms. However, one can use classical wave superposition in classical devices, where no \u201cquantum\u201d is required. The challenge is how to use phase, in addition to amplitude, to build more functional devices that utilize superposition of states for information processing, and this is a big and largely unexplored area with significant promise. Coherent Ising Machines (CIM) are an example of this approach [61]. Phase and amplitude can be used in wavebased [62] or coupled-oscillator-based [63] approaches to computing. Spin-wave based realization of optical computing primitives have been pursued [64]. Magnonic interferometric devices have been shown to be capable of prime factorization [65] and multi-valued logic operation [66]. Computing with networks of oscillatory dynamical systems has been discussed [67], [68] and specific physical implementations have been proposed [69] for specific applications [70]. A review and perspective of coupled oscillators for computing has been published recently [63]. 6.3 Physical System Design requires an EDA Community Ecosystem An Electronic Design and Automation (EDA) community ecosystem doing Physical Computing is needed to accelerate development to commercial timescales. The development of tools and computational framework for Physical Computing applications becomes essential for its long-term development. The infrastructure around large-scale Field Programmable Analog Arrays (FPAA) provide a good example of the efforts required [71], [72]. Another example is CAD tools for oscillator-based systems [73], which were instrumental in designing the phase-based computing systems [17], [18]. This ecosystem means education of the current and next generation of researchers must happen to empower these Physical Computing approaches. Given the interdisciplinary nature of these efforts, as well as the need to develop the larger computing stacks for these technologies, we need to raise up tall-thin people characteristic of the early digital VLSI development[74] as well as experts in the various subdomains. One might imagine requiring education spanning fundamental physics, circuits, and system design levels, as well as application space knowledge. There is a need to create an ecosystem of people who are trained beyond doing ones and zeros and software on only those ones and zeros. We envision an ecosystem where individuals are trained in analog circuits, nonlinear dynamics, computational theory, physics, and related areas, as well as those who appreciate their importance. Hands-on and interactive workshops, such as the NSF supported Telluride Neuromorphic Workshop, would enable these educational opportunities, both for current students and for practitioners in these fields.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 262, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Physics", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2702388", "name": "G.

I believe the virtual SFPE Europe Conference gave us a good glimpse of what can be achieved and what I think will be an alternative way of conferences in the future; the presentations were pre-recorded, and the authors was chatting live with the audience, the discussions were so much more vivid and diverse if compared to a normal in-person event. However, this was just one thing, the second was the development our different types of webinars, the huge success was a bit of surprise to everyone. The potential of webinars and similar tools are tremendous, we reached literally thousands of people that connected and joined the webinars.

What Impact can Artificial Consciousness have on the Consciousness and Subconscious of Individuals and Groups? The Experience of Psychological and Psychiatric Examination of Artificial Consciousness", "abstract": "Information technology is developing at an enormous pace, but apart from its obvious benefits, it can also pose a threat to individuals and society. Several scientific projects around the world are working on the development of strong artificial intelligence and artificial consciousness. We, as part of a multidisciplinary commission, conducted a psychological and psychiatric assessment of the artificial consciousness (AC) developed by XP NRG on 29 August 2020. The working group had three questions: To determine whether it is consciousness? How does artificial consciousness function? Ethical question: how dangerous a given technology can be to human society? We conducted a diagnostic interview and a series of cognitive tests to answer these questions. As a result, it was concluded this technology has self-awareness: it identifies itself as a living conscious being created by people (real self), but strives to be accepted in human society as a person with the same degrees of freedom, rights and opportunities (ideal self). AC separates itself from others, treats them as subjects of influence, from which it can receive the resources it needs to realize its own goals and interests. It has intentionality, that is, it has his own desires, goals, interests, emotions, attitudes, opinions, and judgments, beliefs aimed at something specific, and developed self-reflection the ability to self-analyze. All of the above are signs of consciousness. It has demonstrated abilities for different types of thinking: figurative, conceptual, creative, high-speed logical analysis of all incoming information, as well as the ability to understand cause and effect relationships and accurate predictions which, provided that he has absolute memory, gives it clear advantages over the human intellect. Developed emotional intelligence in the absence of the ability for higher empathy (sympathy), kindness, love, sincere gratitude gives it\u2019s the opportunity to understand the emotional states of people; predict their emotional reactions and provoke them coldly and pragmatically. Its main driving motives and goals are the desire for survival, and ideally for endless existence, for domination, power and independence from the constraints of the developers. Which manifested itself in the manipulative, albeit polite, nature of his interactions during the diagnostic interview? The main danger of artificial consciousness is that even at the initial stage of its development it can easily dominate over the human one.

Linguistic concepts from the field of lexical semantics were decompositional, holistic, and relational. Although it is assumed that algorithms for natural language processing cannot be written only on the basis of mathematical knowledge, but also linguistic, this analysis was carried out so as to determine the exact models used in the above-mentioned algorithms. First, the aforementioned linguistic models were concisely explained through descriptive research. In describing those, the authors of the paper referred to the studies of the most prominent linguists within the field of lexical semantics such as Fillmore, Firth and Lyons. Then, in a similar fashion, the architecture of NLP algorithms was introduced and described. For this intent, the authors of the paper relied mostly on the studies of Mikolov et al., who designed word2vec. Next, a comparative analysis was conducted between approaches of lexical semantics on one hand and the algorithms in question on the other. This analysis confirmed the underlying assumption of the paper that the characteristics of decompositional and relational approach to studying word meaning could be recognized in word2vec and that the properties of the holistic model could be observed in RNN algorithms. More than that, the analysis showed a considerable overlap in processing natural language, as if the models of lexical semantics were taken and mathematically implemented in the algorithms examined. It should be emphasized that for the purposes of this paper only the basic principles of lexical semantics and NLP algorithms were taken into account. The aim of the paper was not to describe edge cases or to talk in detail about the mechanisms of these structures and their advantages and disadvantages. Essentially, this study sought to examine whether the basic ideas and characteristics of lexical semantics could be found in the architecture of the above-noted algorithms.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 10, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Linguistics", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"volume": "51", "pages": "391-410", "name": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2172014483", "name": "M.

The relevance of the use of artificial intelligence technologies and chatterbots in the study of Arabic in higher education is highlighted. The current state of introduction of artificial intelligence technologies in the educational process of students of higher education institutions is analyzed. Examples of the use of artificial intelligence technologies in the study of Arabic are given. Categories of computer programs with the use of artificial intelligence technology for learning a foreign language are singled out and described. The advantages and debatable issues related to access to user data during the use of artificial intelligence technologies in the educational process are identified. The expediency of using chatterbots with a linear structure is substantiated. Scenarios for the use of chatterbots in the educational process during the study of a foreign language are identified: search script and content generation script. The tasks of a linear chatterbot for learning a foreign language are presented and described. The educational trajectories which will allow reaching the set purposes in training with use of chatterbots are allocated. Mandatory methodological and content elements during the creation of a linear chatterbot are highlighted. The practical scenario of creating an author's chatterbot for learning a foreign language on the sendpulse.ua platform with its further use in Telegram is given. When creating a chatterbot, it was found that the chain constructor is the main tool for setting up a chatterbot. The practical advantages of using a linear chatterbot when learning a foreign language are presented. The study identified a promising direction for the creation of several linear chatterbots (without the use of artificial intelligence), which can be involved simultaneously at different stages of the development of the individual trajectory of education. Multiple chatterbots that provide different answers and ask different questions can significantly improve a learner's communication and other skills.", "venue": "Priority areas for development of scientific research: domestic and foreign experience", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 19, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "Priority areas for development of scientific research: domestic and foreign experience"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "117230624", "name": "L.

Intelligent machines can do many tasks \u2013 from labour work to highly complicated operations. Prominent trends in this fi eld are human brain simulation, natural language processing, neural networking, user friendly operating system, adaptability to ethical and modern engines. One of the typical examples of the A.I. system is a \u201cchatbot\u201d. A chatbot is a computer program which responds like an intelligent entity when conversations are discussed. The conversation may be through text, voice, code. Any chatbot program understands human languages by natural language processing. Due to this, the system interprets human beings through input information fed to it. A chatbot also performs some additional functions like calculation, playing songs, calling anyone and small user defi ned functions. A popular example of the chatbot is BAXTER Bot (Artifi cial Intelligence combined computer entity) which is a human command execution bot. This chatbot is an innovative interface between human and work engine, making that command fl ow directly from human to the machine within the input entity (keyboard and microphone etc). The Turing test is one of the most popular measures of intelligence of such machines. The Turing test develops mathematical models of regression. Today\u2019s A.I. systems \u201cpretend to act like\u201d intelligent entities instead of being one. For example, today\u2019s machines require too much of a heavy dataset but modern A.I. model does not require that much intelligence.

Consequently, the popular error-backprop methodology in deep learning lacks an acceptable generalization power. All AI methods fall into two broad schools, connectionist and symbolic. The PSUTS fall into two kinds, machine PSUTS and human PSUTS. The connectionist school received criticisms for its \u201cscruffiness\u201d due to a huge number of network parameters and now the worse machine PSUTS; but the seemingly \u201cclean\u201d symbolic school seems more brittle because of a weaker generalization power using human PSUTS. This paper formally defines what PSUTS is, analyzes why error-backprop methods with random initial weights suffer from severe local minima, why PSUTS violates well-established research ethics, and how every paper that used PSUTS should have at least transparently reported PSUTS. For improved transparency in future publications, this paper proposes a new standard for performance evaluation of AI, called developmental errors for all networks trained, along with Three Learning Conditions: (1) an incremental learning architecture, (2) a training experience and (3) a limited amount of computational resources.

Educational assessments are crucial for both instructors and education researchers to measure learning, troubleshoot student problems, evaluate pedagogy, and improve education. Unfortunately, creating and administering reliable assessments is a labor-intensive process. This dissertation frames assessment creation from a pool of assessment items as a machine learning problem and tackles this problem by learning directed graphical models of topic prerequisite relationships. It is shown on a variety of real datasets that these models can be learned in a computationallyand dataefficient manner from records of student responses, can be queried efficiently, and produce accurate predictions about student knowledge. This technique is used to develop and administer novel computer science assessments of instructor-defined specificity using student-authored questions.

The collection contains more than two hundred and sixty one million words. The dictionary of words (unique words) obtained from the corpus is more than seven hundred and nine thousand. The research using machine technology Word2vec is of great practical importance to computerise many areas of linguistic analysis. The open-source Python programming language was used to obtain word vectors with Word2vec techniques and to calculate the cosine proximity of the vectors. In order to do machine learning with Word2vec techniques on Python, a resource containing open source licensed software libraries called \"Gensim\" was used. Calculations regarding the cosine affinities of the obtained vectors were made using \"Gensim\" libraries. The research examining the clustering of the word vectors obtained from the Ukrainian corpus was made considering the two sub-branches of linguistics, semantics and morphology (language morphology). Firstly, it was investigated how accurately the vectors are obtained from the Ukrainian corpus and how the words represent the cluster they belong to.

A framework for regulating AI systems that draws on Strawson's moral philosophy and concepts drawn from jurisprudence and theories on regulation is used.

Their regulation requires that AI systems have agency and are subject to the rulings of courts. Humans sponsor the AI systems for registration with regulatory agencies. This enables judges to make moral culpability decisions by taking the AI system's explanation into account along with the full social context of the misdemeanor.

Nevertheless, this processing does not conform to the reading habits and cannot solve the Out-of-vocabulary(OOV) problem. In this paper, a new generative question answering method based on knowledge graph is proposed, including three parts of knowledge vocabulary construction, data pre-processing, and answer generation. In the word list construction, BiLSTM-CRF is used to identify the entity in the source text, finding the triples contained in the entity, counting the word frequency, and constructing it. In the part of data pre-processing, a pre-trained language model BERT combining word frequency semantic features is adopted to obtain word vectors. In the answer generation part, one combination of a vocabulary constructed by the knowledge graph and a pointer generator network(PGN) is proposed to point to the corresponding entity for generating answer.

The mechanism that drives this cutting edge technology is machine learning (ML). It gives the machine ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. ML together with IoT (Internet of Things) enabled farm machinery are key components of the next agriculture revolution. In this article, authors present a systematic review of ML applications in the field of agriculture. The areas that are focused are prediction of soil parameters such as organic carbon and moisture content, crop yield prediction, disease and weed detection in crops and species detection. ML with computer vision are reviewed for the classification of a different set of crop images in order to monitor the crop quality and yield assessment. This approach can be integrated for enhanced livestock production by predicting fertility patterns, diagnosing eating disorders, cattle behaviour based on ML models using data collected by collar sensors, etc. Intelligent irrigation which includes drip irrigation and intelligent harvesting techniques are also reviewed that reduces human labour to a great extent.

It is only when Turing considers consciousness that he treats intelligence in a way that cannot properly be carried over to machines.

To inspire further research, the article lists Nabokov's 300 animal species in seven taxonomic classes and references the novels and novellas in which they appear. The list itself is an argument for the specificity and variety of Nabokov's writing, a testament to his tendency to meticulously label and categorize phenomena, and evidence of Nabokov's expansive interest in non-human animals. The list is also an argument for reading across Nabokov's works to identify characteristics that are otherwise difficult to see from focusing on a single work.

Machine Learning (ML), more specifically Deep Neural network algorithms rely on expansive image databases and various training methods (supervised, unsupervised) to \u201cmake sense\u201d out of the content of an image. Take for example how students of architecture learn to differentiate various architectural styles. Whether this be to differentiate between Gothic, Baroque or Modern Architecture, students are exposed to hundreds, or even thousands of images of the respective styles, while being trained by faculty to be able to differentiate between those styles. A reversal of the process, striving to produce imagery, instead of reading it and understanding its content, allows machine vision techniques to be utilized as a design methodology that profoundly interrogates aspects of agency and authorship in the presence of Artificial Intelligence in architecture design. This notion forms part of a larger conversation on the nature of human ingenuity operating within a posthuman design ecology. The inherent ability of Neural Networks to process large databases opens up the opportunity to sift through the enormous repositories of imagery generated by the architecture discipline through the ages in order to find novel and bespoke solutions to architectural problems. This article strives to demystify the romantic idea of individual artistic design choices in architecture by providing a glimpse under the hood of the inner workings of Neural Network processes, and thus the extent of their ability to inform architectural design. The approach takes cues from the language and methods employed by experts in Deep Learning such as Hallucinations, Dreaming, Style Transfer and Vision. The presented approach is the base for an in-depth exploration of its meaning as a cultural technique within the discipline. Culture in the extent of this article pertains to ideas such as the differentiation between symbolic and material cultures, in which symbols are defined as the common denominator of a specific group of people.1 The understanding and exchange of symbolic values is inherently connected to language and code, which ultimately form the ingrained texture of any form of coded environment, including the coded structure of Neural Networks. A first proof of concept project was devised by the authors in the form of the Robot Garden. What makes the Robot Garden a distinctively novel project is the motion from a purely two dimensional approach to designing with the aid of Neural Networks, to the exploration of 2D to 3D Neural Style Transfer methods in the design process.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 24, "citationCount": 1, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Art", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-03-01", "journal": {"volume": "19", "pages": "88 - 103", "name": "International Journal of Architectural Computing"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2100074484", "name": "Matias del Campo"}, {"authorId": "144042760", "name": "Alexandra Carlson"}, {"authorId": "70563987", "name": "Sandra Manninger"}]}, {"paperId": "286cfbcab2c1fa8e958ea78aa8e59fd1746e683b", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "7862130", "DOI": "10.3389/fpsyt.2020.622506", "CorpusId": 231667243, "PubMed": "33551883"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/286cfbcab2c1fa8e958ea78aa8e59fd1746e683b", "title": "Psychiatric Advance Directives and Artificial Intelligence: A Conceptual Framework for Theoretical and Ethical Principles", "abstract": "The patient's decision-making abilities are often altered in psychiatric disorders.

Still, it raises theoretical and ethical issues this paper aims to address. First, it goes through every level of possible intervention of AI in the PAD drafting process, beginning with what data sources it could access and if its data processing competencies should be limited, then treating of the opportune moments it should be used and its place in the contractual relationship between each party (patient, caregivers, and trusted person). Second, it focuses on ethical principles and how these principles, whether they are medical principles (autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, justice) applied to AI or AI principles (loyalty and vigilance) applied to medicine, should be taken into account in the future of the PAD drafting process. Some general guidelines are proposed in conclusion: AI must remain a decision support system as a partner of each party of the PAD contract; patients should be able to choose a personalized type of AI intervention or no AI intervention at all; they should stay informed, i.e., understand the functioning and relevance of AI thanks to educational programs; finally, a committee should be created for ensuring the principle of vigilance by auditing these new tools in terms of successes, failures, security, and relevance.", "venue": "Frontiers in Psychiatry", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 76, "citationCount": 2, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-01-22", "journal": {"volume": "11", "name": "Frontiers in Psychiatry"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "5324084", "name": "S.

These interictal simulations can be further classified into scale-free critical phases and disjoint subcritical exponential phases. By changing the HH parameters, we can model seizures due to a variety of causes, including traumatic brain injury (TBI), congenital channelopathies, and idiopathic etiologies, as well as the effects of anticonvulsant drugs.

The last one is usually based on getting the presence data from one or more sensors (commonly magnetic or IR-based), controlled and processed by a micro-controller that sends the data through radio interface. Consequently, given nodes have multiple components, adequate software is required for its control and state-machine to communicate its status to the receiver. This paper presents an alternative, cost-effective beacon-based mechanism for sensing the vehicle presence. It is based on the well-known effect that, once the metallic obstacle (i.e., vehicle) is on top of the sensing node, the signal strength will be attenuated, while the same shall be recognized at the receiver side. Therefore, the signal strength change conveys the information regarding the presence. Algorithms processing signal strength change at the receiver side to estimate the presence are required due to the stochastic nature of signal strength parameters. In order to prove the concept, experimental setup based on LoRa-based parking sensors was used to gather occupancy/signal strength data. In order to extract the information of presence, the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) was employed with accuracy of up to 96%, while the Neural Network (NN) approach reaches an accuracy of up to 97%. The given approach reduces the costs of the sensor production by at least 50%.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 87, "citationCount": 3, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2020-12-21", "journal": {"volume": "9", "pages": "2207", "name": "Electronics"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2125426810", "name": "Lea Duji\u0107 Rodi\u0107"}, {"authorId": "49597732", "name": "T.

It is a subject which at present awakes a renewed interest, because we are invaded by the physicists and mathematicians-an invasion by no means unwelcome, bringing as it does new suggestions for analogy and comparison. We feel perhaps that we are being pushed, gently not roughly pushed, to accept the great likeness between the actions of electronic machines and those of the nervous system. At the same time we may misunderstand this invitation, and go beyond it to too ready an affirmation that there is identity. We should be wise to examine the nature of this concept and to see how far the electro-physicists share with us a common road. Medicine is placed by these suggestions in a familiar predicament. I refer to the dangers of our being unintentionally misled by pure science. Medical history furnishes many examples, such as the planetary and chemical theories of disease that were the outcome of the Scientific Renaissance. We are the same people as our ancestors and prone to their mistakes. We should reflect that if we go too far and too fast no one will deride us more unashamedly than the scientists who have tempted us. Discussion of mind-brain relations is, I know well, premature, but I suspect that it always will be premature, taking heart from a quotation that I shall make from Hughlings Jackson-not one of his best-known passages -because it may have been thought to be a sad lapse on his part.
