      evaluation of a microcredit program introduced in rural areas of Morocco in
      2006. Thirteen percent of the households in treatment villages took a loan,
      and none in control villages did. Among households identified as more likely
      to borrow, microcredit access led to a significant rise in investment in assets
      used for self-employment activities, and an increase in profit, but also to
      a reduction in income from casual labor. Overall there was no gain in income
      or consumption. We find suggestive evidence that these results are mainly driven
      by effects on borrowers, rather than by externalities. ( JEL D14, G21, J23,

      "abstract": "Despite the extensive spread of micro finance, studies on the actual
      impact of MFIs are often more ambivalent about its impact than is the aid community.
      Much has been written on the range of institutional arrangements pursued in
      different organizations and countries and in turn a vast number studies have
      attempted to assess the outreach and poverty impact of such schemes. However,
      amongst the academic development community there is a recognition that perhaps
      we know much less about the impact of these programs than might be expected
      given the enthusiasm for these activities in donor and policy-making circles.
      In recognition of this uncertainty this paper aims to bring together some of
      the recent evidence that has been accumulating on the impact of microfinance
      activities on poverty reduction. In particular we ask what is the evidence on

      institutional and economic factors do not explain the heterogeneity in the relationship
      of interest. Alternatively, we show that disenfranchisement laws in the U.S.
      mediates the effect of education on voter turnout, such that the education gradient
      in voting is greater in U.S. States with the harshest disenfranchisement legislature.

      the Japanese daycare market, where waitlisted applicants are granted additional
      priority points in subsequent application rounds. Utilizing data from Tokyo''s
      Bunkyo municipality, this paper provides evidence of considerable manipulation,
      with parents strategically choosing to be waitlisted to enhance the likelihood
      of their child''s admission into more selective daycare centers. I extend the
      static framework of school choice posited by Agarwal and Somaini (2018) to incorporate
      dynamic incentives and estimate a structural model that allows for reapplication
      if waitlisted. Empirical findings indicate that approximately 30% of applicants
      forgo listing safer options in their initial application, a behavior significantly
      pronounced among those who stand to benefit from the waitlist prioritization.
      Counterfactual simulations, conducted under the scenario of no additional waitlist
      priority, predict a 17.7% decrease in the number of waitlisted applicants and
      a 1.2% increase in overall welfare. These findings highlight the profound influence
      of dynamic incentives on applicant behavior and underscore the necessity for
      reevaluating current priority mechanisms.", "venue": "", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

      support for welfare policies. Focusing on the revenue side of the welfare state
      rather than the spending side, we present the opposite argument: We predict
      that economic decline makes individuals less tolerant of paying taxes, because
      tax increases would imply a reduction of their consumption level. We test this
      argument using longitudinal data from both repeated cross-sections and panel
      surveys in the United States, Canada and Japan. Our main finding is that tolerance
      of paying taxes is lower when individuals perceive that their economic situation
      deteriorates. Thus, perceived economic decline can create political obstacles

      down registration costs and taxes and aims to study startup survival determinants.
      Using a rich combination of administrative records that allow us to follow in
      time the universe of formal firms in the country, we analyze static and dynamic
      effects on new formal firm''s creation and the quality of the new firms created
      by testing whether they had a higher probability of survival due to the reform,
      and whether the firms created faced fewer financial constraints through access
      to formal credit. We find that the reform increased the number of formal small
      firms registered by 30%, but we do not find evidence that the newly formalized
      firms that benefited from the reform had a higher probability of survival, which
      means that reducing formalization costs could not be enough to improve the quality
      of the new firms created. We, therefore, consider a statistical model to rationalize
      the determinants of firm size and firm survival.", "venue": "", "year": null,
