      on the impacts of microcredit continue to evolve. Early evidence from randomized

      average borrower across many contexts. However, a subset of high-potential entrepreneurs
      saw high returns to microcredit. More recent research similarly finds that certain

      to borrow, microcredit access led to a significant rise in investment in assets
      used for self-employment activities, and an increase in profit, but also to
      a reduction in income from casual labor. Overall there was no gain in income
      or consumption. We find suggestive evidence that these results are mainly driven

      The US has occasionally resorted to coups to realign the foreign policy preferences
      in allied nations with its own preferences. This article explains why coups
      were more likely in countries where the leaders enjoyed an incumbency advantage
      that thwarted the ability of potential successors to gain power through regular
      channels of leadership turnover. That was more likely to be the case in presidential
      than in parliamentary democracies, and more likely in personalistic, military,
      or single-party regimes than in autocracies with multiparty legislatures.",

      "Industrial delicensing, which began in 1985 in India marked a discrete break

      episodes are taking place across the globe. We develop a simple Schumpeterian
      growth model to understand how firms respond to the entry threat imposed by
      liberalization. The model emphasizes that firm responses, even within the same
      industrial sector, are likely to be heterogeneous leading to an increase in
      within industry inequality. Technologically advanced firms and those located
      in regions with pro-business institutions are more likely to respond to the
      threat of entry by investing in new technologies and production processes. Empirical
      analysis using a panel of three-digit stateindustry data from India for the

      POLICY: EVIDENCE FROM A NARRATIVE APPROACH", "abstract": "We analyze the macroeconomic
      effects of macroprudential policy \u2013 in the form of legal reserve requirements
      \u2013 in three Latin American countries (Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay). To
      correctly identify innovations in changes in legal reserve requirements, we
      develop a narrative approach \u2013 based on contemporaneous reports from the
      IMF and Central Banks in the spirit of Romer and Romer (2010) \u2013 that classifies
      each change into endogenous or exogenous to the business cycle. We show that
      this distinction is critical in understanding the macroeconomic effects of reserve
      requirements. In particular, we show that output falls in response to exogenous
      increases in legal reserve requirements but would seem not to be affected (or
      could even increase!) when using all changes and relying on traditional time-identifying
      strategies. This bias reflects the practical relevance of the misidentification
      of endogenous countercyclical changes in reserve requirements. We also push
      the empirical frontier along two important dimensions. First, in measuring legal
      reserve requirements, we take into account both the different types of legal
      reserve requirements in terms of maturity and currency of denomination as well
      as the structure of deposits. Second, since in practice reserve requirement
      policy is tightly linked to monetary policy, we also jointly analyze the macroeconomic
      effects of changes in central bank interest rates. To properly identify exogenous
      central bank interest rate shocks, we follow Romer and Romer (2004). Diego Rojas

      connected to it. This article aims to help fill this gap by proposing a theoretical
      and operational definition of free and fair elections. For this purpose, the
      ten dimensions that make up the concept and the procedures to be followed to
      arrive at their measurement are described in depth. At the end of the analysis,
      we propose an index that measures the level of freedom and fairness of the elections.",

      the Swedish primary rental market, many individuals turn to long-term sublets
      to satisfy their housing demand. A lack of accessible data has made study of
      this market difficult. Using a unique dataset, we exploit weekly temporal variation
      over multiple treatment windows to analyze rent levels around the start of the
      Swedish university semester. We uncover strong effects, with monthly rent increasing
      between 3.31 percent and 4.22 percent during the treatment period. The effects
      peak immediately after the university semester has started and are concentrated
      to the tails of the distribution of living space. The results are robust to
      a range of alternative specifications and sample sizes. [112 words]", "venue":

      We then test the model\u2019s predictions using a novel dataset on asset encumbrance
      of the European banks. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that banks with more
      costly asset encumbrance have higher rates of overcollateralisation and rely
      less on secured debt. Consistent with theory, the effects are stronger for banks

      Brazil is an emblematic financialization case in which a high Selic interest
      rate benefited financial institutions. However, the real Selic rate has historically
      declined, becoming negative in 2020. As a result, one should expect banks\u2019
      incomes to be negatively affected, yet this was not the case. Banks overcame
      this macroeconomic challenge by increasing credit operations. Within this context,
      our study confirms that the increasing credit spread income is inversely correlated
      to the declining Selic rate. Hence, we conclude that banks have maintained a
      rentier behavior: security gains derived from the past high Selic rate phase
      were replaced by a high spread charged to credit consumers.", "venue": "Brazilian

      type and level of pre-support income, whereas between farm-type HI arises from
