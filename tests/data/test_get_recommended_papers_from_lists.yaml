        "title": "BUILDING MINIMUM SPANNING TREES BY LIMITED NUMBER OF NODES OVER
        TRIANGULATED SET OF INITIAL NODES", "abstract": "Background. The common purpose
        of modelling and using minimum spanning trees is to ensure efficient coverage.
        In many tasks of designing efficient telecommunication networks, the number
        of network nodes is usually limited. In terms of rational allocation, there
        are more possible locations than factually active tools to be settled to those
        locations. \nObjective. Given an initial set of planar nodes, the problem
        is to build a minimum spanning tree connecting a given number of the nodes,
        which can be less than the cardinality of the initial set. The root node is
        primarily assigned, but it can be changed if needed. \nMethods. To obtain
        a set of edges, a Delaunay triangulation is performed over the initial set
        of nodes. Distances between every pair of the nodes in respective edges are
        calculated. These distances being the lengths of the respective edges are
        used as graph weights, and a minimum spanning tree is built over this graph.
        \nResults. The problem always has a solution if the desired number of nodes
        (the number of available recipient nodes) is equal to the number of initially
        given nodes. If the desired number is lesser, the maximal edge length is found
        and the edges of the maximal length are excluded while the number of minimum
        spanning tree nodes is greater than the desired number of nodes. \nConclusions.
        To build a minimum spanning tree by a limited number of nodes it is suggested
        to use the Delaunay triangulation and an iterative procedure in order to meet
        the desired number of nodes. Planar nodes of an initial set are triangulated,
        whereupon the edge lengths are used as weights of a graph. The iterations
        to reduce nodes are done only if there are redundant nodes. When failed, the
        root node must be changed before the desired number of nodes is changed.",

        Nodes Characterized by Supplies and Demands", "abstract": "Suppose we are
        given a graph with nodes characterized by amounts of supplies and demands
        of multiple commodities. The amounts of commodities stored at nodes (supplies)
        are given by positive numbers while those of demands at nodes are given by
        negative numbers. To meet demands we send commodities from nodes to neighbors
        by using vehicles, one at each node, with some loading capacity moving to
        and from neighbors. In this paper we adopt a one-way transportation model
        in which we just send commodities from a node to one of its neighbors along
        an edge. When we choose one neighbor at each node, we have a set of trips
        which naturally define a graph such that each connected component has at most
        one cycle, which is known as a pseudoforest. We present a linear-time algorithm
        for deciding whether there is a set of trips that meet all demands using one-way
        multi-commodity transportations on a pseudoforest with node degrees bounded
        by a constant. Using the algorithm, we first present an efficient algorithm
        for finding an optimal set of one-way one-commodity trips that minimize the

        "title": "Optimal Near-Linear Space Heaviest Induced Ancestors", "abstract":
        "We revisit the Heaviest Induced Ancestors (HIA) problem that was introduced
        by Gagie, Gawrychowski, and Nekrich [CCCG 2013] and has a number of applications
        in string algorithms. Let T1 and T2 be two rooted trees whose nodes have weights
        that are increasing in all root-to-leaf paths, and labels on the leaves, such
        that no two leaves of a tree have the same label. A pair of nodes (u, v) \u2208
        T1 \u00d7 T2 is induced if and only if there is a label shared by leaf-descendants
        of u and v. In an HIA query, given nodes x \u2208 T1 and y \u2208 T2, the
        goal is to find an induced pair of nodes (u, v) of the maximum total weight
        such that u is an ancestor of x and v is an ancestor of y. Let n be the upper
        bound on the sizes of the two trees. It is known that no data structure of
        size \u00d5(n) can answer HIA queries in o(log n/ log log n) time [Charalampopoulos,
        Gawrychowski, Pokorski; ICALP 2020].1 This (unconditional) lower bound is
        a polyloglog n factor away from the query time of the fastest \u00d5(n)-size
        data structure known to date for the HIA problem [Abedin, Hooshmand, Ganguly,
        Thankachan; Algorithmica 2022]. In this work, we resolve the query-time complexity
        of the HIA problem for the near-linear space regime by presenting a data structure
        that can be built in \u00d5(n) time and answers HIA queries in O(log n/ log
        log n) time. As a direct corollary, we obtain an \u00d5(n)-size data structure
        that maintains the LCS of a static string and a dynamic string, both of length
        at most n, in time optimal for this space regime. The main ingredients of
        our approach are fractional cascading and the utilization of an O(log n/ log
        log n)-depth tree decomposition. The latter allows us to break through the
        \u03a9(log n) barrier faced by previous works, due to the depth of the considered
        heavy-path decompositions. 2012 ACM Subject Classification Theory of computation

        The problem whether a given spanning tree can be a graph search tree has been
        considered for different searches, graph classes and search tree paradigms.
        Similarly, the question whether a particular vertex can be visited last by

        two problems by considering the question whether a vertex can be a leaf of

        "abstract": "The Independent Cutset problem asks whether there is a set of
        vertices in a given graph that is both independent and a cutset. Such a problem
        is $\\textsf{NP}$-complete even when the input graph is planar and has maximum
        degree five. In this paper, we first present a $\\mathcal{O}^*(1.4423^{n})$-time
        algorithm for the problem. We also show how to compute a minimum independent
        cutset (if any) in the same running time. Since the property of having an
        independent cutset is MSO$_1$-expressible, our main results are concerned
        with structural parameterizations for the problem considering parameters that
        are not bounded by a function of the clique-width of the input. We present
        $\\textsf{FPT}$-time algorithms for the problem considering the following
        parameters: the dual of the maximum degree, the dual of the solution size,
        the size of a dominating set (where a dominating set is given as an additional
        input), the size of an odd cycle transversal, the distance to chordal graphs,
        and the distance to $P_5$-free graphs. We close by introducing the notion
        of $\\alpha$-domination, which allows us to identify more fixed-parameter

        Graphs", "abstract": "We study the reverse shortest path problem on disk graphs
        in the plane. In this problem we consider the proximity graph of a set of
        $n$ disks in the plane of arbitrary radii: In this graph two disks are connected
        if the distance between them is at most some threshold parameter $r$. The
        case of intersection graphs is a special case with $r=0$. We give an algorithm
        that, given a target length $k$, computes the smallest value of $r$ for which
        there is a path of length at most $k$ between some given pair of disks in
        the proximity graph. Our algorithm runs in $O^*(n^{5/4})$ randomized expected
        time, which improves to $O^*(n^{6/5})$ for unit disk graphs, where all the
        disks have the same radius. Our technique is robust and can be applied to
        many variants of the problem. One significant variant is the case of weighted
        proximity graphs, where edges are assigned real weights equal to the distance
        between the disks or between their centers, and $k$ is replaced by a target
        weight $w$; that is, we seek a path whose length is at most $w$. In other
        variants, we want to optimize a parameter different from $r$, such as a scale
        factor of the radii of the disks. The main technique for the decision version
        of the problem (determining whether the graph with a given $r$ has the desired
        property) is based on efficient implementations of BFS (for the unweighted
        case) and of Dijkstra''s algorithm (for the weighted case), using efficient
        data structures for maintaining the bichromatic closest pair for certain bicliques
        and several distance functions. The optimization problem is then solved by
        combining the resulting decision procedure with enhanced variants of the interval
        shrinking and bifurcation technique of [4].", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year":

        even for graphs of maximum degree four and NP-complete even for star graphs.
        On the other hand, we develop an algorithm running in time $O\\left(2^{tw\\log

        treewidth of the graph, size, and target value of the knapsack. We further
        exhibit a $(1-\\epsilon)$ factor approximation algorithm running in time $O\\left(2^{tw\\log

        show similar results for several other graph theoretic properties, namely
        path and shortest-path under the problem names path-knapsack and shortestpath-knapsack.

        "Graph theory and enumerative combinatorics are two branches of mathematical
        sciences that have developed astonishingly over the past one hundred years.
        It is especially important to point out that graph theory employs combinatorial
        techniques to solve key problems of characterization, construction, enumeration
        and classification of an enormous set of different families of graphs. This
        paper describes the construction of two classes of bigeodetic blocks using
        balanced incomplete block designs (BIBDs). On the other hand, even though
        graph theory and combinatorics have a close relationship, the opposite problem,
        that is, considering certain graph constructions when solving problems of
        combinatorics is not common, but possible. The construction of the second
        class of bigeodetic blocks described in this paper represents an example of
        how graph theory could somehow give a clue to the description of a problem
        of existence in combinatorics. We refer to the problem of existence for biplanes.
        A connection between the mentioned construction, the Bruck-Ryser-Chowla theorem
        and the problem of existence for biplanes is considered.", "venue": "arXiv.org",

        a shortest path between two nodes in an undirected unweighted graph is among
        the most basic algorithmic tasks. Breadth first search solves this problem
        in linear time, which is clearly also a lower bound in the worst case. However,
        several works have shown how to solve this problem in sublinear time in expectation
        when the input graph is drawn from one of several classes of random graphs.
        In this work, we extend these results by giving sublinear time shortest path
        (and short path) algorithms for expander graphs. We thus identify a natural
        deterministic property of a graph (that is satisfied by typical random regular
        graphs) which suffices for sublinear time shortest paths. The algorithms are

        a labeling scheme with labels of bit length ( 4 3 + o(1)) logn. All the labels
        of the input graph can be computed in polynomial time, while adjacency can
        be decided from the labels in constant time. In graph-theoretical terms, this

        "title": "On Diameter Approximation in Directed Graphs", "abstract": "Computing
        the diameter of a graph, i.e. the largest distance, is a fundamental problem
        that is central in fine-grained complexity. In undirected graphs, the Strong
        Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) yields a lower bound on the time vs. approximation
        trade-off that is quite close to the upper bounds. In \\emph{directed} graphs,
        however, where only some of the upper bounds apply, much larger gaps remain.
        Since $d(u,v)$ may not be the same as $d(v,u)$, there are multiple ways to
        define the problem, the two most natural being the \\emph{(one-way) diameter}
        ($\\max_{(u,v)} d(u,v)$) and the \\emph{roundtrip diameter} ($\\max_{u,v}
        d(u,v)+d(v,u)$). In this paper we make progress on the outstanding open question
        for each of them. -- We design the first algorithm for diameter in sparse
        directed graphs to achieve $n^{1.5-\\varepsilon}$ time with an approximation
        factor better than $2$. The new upper bound trade-off makes the directed case
        appear more similar to the undirected case. Notably, this is the first algorithm
        for diameter in sparse graphs that benefits from fast matrix multiplication.
        -- We design new hardness reductions separating roundtrip diameter from directed
        and undirected diameter. In particular, a $1.5$-approximation in subquadratic
        time would refute the All-Nodes $k$-Cycle hypothesis, and any $(2-\\varepsilon)$-approximation
        would imply a breakthrough algorithm for approximate $\\ell_{\\infty}$-Closest-Pair.

        not based on SETH.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

        Trees", "abstract": "Over the past decade, a long line of research has investigated
        the distributed complexity landscape of locally checkable labeling (LCL) problems
        on bounded-degree graphs, culminating in an almost-complete classification
        on general graphs and a complete classification on trees. The latter states
        that, on bounded-degree trees, any LCL problem has deterministic \\emph{worst-case}
        time complexity $O(1)$, $\\Theta(\\log^* n)$, $\\Theta(\\log n)$, or $\\Theta(n^{1/k})$
        for some positive integer $k$, and all of those complexity classes are nonempty.
        Moreover, randomness helps only for (some) problems with deterministic worst-case
        complexity $\\Theta(\\log n)$, and if randomness helps (asymptotically), then
        it helps exponentially. In this work, we study how many distributed rounds
        are needed \\emph{on average per node} in order to solve an LCL problem on
        trees. We obtain a partial classification of the deterministic \\emph{node-averaged}
        complexity landscape for LCL problems. As our main result, we show that every
        problem with worst-case round complexity $O(\\log n)$ has deterministic node-averaged
        complexity $O(\\log^* n)$. We further establish bounds on the node-averaged
        complexity of problems with worst-case complexity $\\Theta(n^{1/k})$: we show
        that all these problems have node-averaged complexity $\\widetilde{\\Omega}(n^{1
        / (2^k - 1)})$, and that this lower bound is tight for some problems.", "venue":

        $t$ longer than the shortest oriented cycle in the complete bi-directed graph.
        We investigate the problem of computing sparse graphs with small oriented
        dilation. As we can show that minimising oriented dilation for a given number
        of edges is NP-hard in the plane, we first consider one-dimensional point
        sets. While obtaining a $1$-spanner in this setting is straightforward, already
        for five points such a spanner has no plane embedding with the leftmost and
        rightmost point on the outer face. This leads to restricting to oriented graphs

        Distance Oracles, Tree Covers, and More", "abstract": "The notion of shortcut
        partition, introduced recently by Chang, Conroy, Le, Milenkovi\\''c, Solomon,
        and Than [CCLMST23], is a new type of graph partition into low-diameter clusters.
        Roughly speaking, the shortcut partition guarantees that for every two vertices
        $u$ and $v$ in the graph, there exists a path between $u$ and $v$ that intersects
        only a few clusters. They proved that any planar graph admits a shortcut partition
        and gave several applications, including a construction of tree cover for
        arbitrary planar graphs with stretch $1+\\varepsilon$ and $O(1)$ many trees
        for any fixed $\\varepsilon \\in (0,1)$. However, the construction heavily
        exploits planarity in multiple steps, and is thus inherently limited to planar
        graphs. In this work, we breach the\"planarity barrier\"to construct a shortcut
        partition for $K_r$-minor-free graphs for any $r$. To this end, we take a
        completely different approach -- our key contribution is a novel deterministic
        variant of the cop decomposition in minor-free graphs [And86, AGG14]. Our
        shortcut partition for $K_r$-minor-free graphs yields several direct applications.
        Most notably, we construct the first optimal distance oracle for $K_r$-minor-free
        graphs, with $1+\\varepsilon$ stretch, linear space, and constant query time
        for any fixed $\\varepsilon \\in (0,1)$. The previous best distance oracle
        [AG06] uses $O(n\\log n)$ space and $O(\\log n)$ query time, and its construction
        relies on Robertson-Seymour structural theorem and other sophisticated tools.
        We also obtain the first tree cover of $O(1)$ size for minor-free graphs with
        stretch $1+\\varepsilon$, while the previous best $(1+\\varepsilon)$-tree
        cover has size $O(\\log^2 n)$ [BFN19].", "venue": "", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

        graph $G$ admit a tree-decomposition in which every bag has diameter at most
        $d$? One necessary condition is that there is no ``geodesic'''' cycle of length
        more than $3d$; but this is not sufficient, even qualitatively, because one
        can make graphs in which every geodesic cycle has length at most four, and
        yet every tree-decomposition has a bag with large diameter. But there is a
        more general necessary condition. A ``geodesic loaded cycle'''' in $G$ is
        a pair $(C,F)$, where $C$ is a cycle of $G$ and $F\\subseteq E(C)$, such that
        for every pair $u,v$ of vertices of $C$, one of the paths of $C$ between $u,v$
        contains at most $d_G(u,v)$ $F$-edges, where $d_G(u,v)$ is the distance between
        $u,v$ in $G$. We will show that $G$ admits a tree-decomposition in which every
        bag has small diameter, if and only if $|F|$ is small for every geodesic loaded
        cycle $(C,F)$. Admitting a tree-decomposition with bags of bounded diameter
        is known as having ``bounded tree-length'''' in algorithmic graph theory,
        and our proof of the theorem above is similar to an algorithm to approximate
        tree-length by Dourisboure and Gavoille. Also, admitting such a tree-decomposition
        turns out to be equivalent to a popular property from metrical geometry, being
        ``boundedly quasi-isometric to a tree'''', and our theorem above about geodesic
        loaded cycles is essentially a rediscovery of Manning''s theorem in metric
        space theory. The goal of this paper is to tie all these concepts together,
        and add a few more related ideas. For instance, we prove a conjecture of Rose
        McCarty, that $G$ admits a tree-decomposition in which every bag has small
        diameter, if and only if for all vertices $u,v,w$ of $G$, some ball of small
        radius meets every path joining two of $u,v,w$.", "venue": "", "year": 2023,

        "We develop the theory of $k$-cores in hypergraphs based on the assumption
        that a hyperedge can only be intact if all its nodes are undamaged. This scenario
        applies for instance to supply chains where the production of a product requires
        all raw materials and all processing steps; in biology it applies to protein-interaction
        networks where protein complexes can only function if all the proteins are
        present, and it applies as well to chemical reaction networks where a chemical
        reaction can take place only when all the reactants are present. Formulating
        a message-passing theory for hypergraph $k$-core percolation, and combining
        it with the theory of critical phenomena on networks we demonstrate that the
        set of $k$-core problems for locally tree-like hypergraphs is much richer

        "A multi-labelled tree (or MUL-tree) is a rooted tree leaf-labelled by a set
        of labels, where each label may appear more than once in the tree. We consider
        the MUL-tree Set Pruning for Consistency problem (MULSETPC), which takes as
        input a set of MUL-trees and asks whether there exists a perfect pruning of
        each MUL-tree that results in a consistent set of single-labelled trees. MULSETPC
        was proven to be NP-complete by Gascon et al. when the MUL-trees are binary,
        each leaf label is used at most three times, and the number of MUL-trees is
        unbounded. To determine the computational complexity of the problem when the
        number of MUL-trees is constant was left as an open problem. Here, we resolve
        this question by proving a much stronger result, namely that MULSETPC is NP-complete
        even when there are only two MUL-trees, every leaf label is used at most twice,
        and every MUL-tree is either binary or has constant height. Furthermore, we
        introduce an extension of MULSETPC that we call MULSETPComp, which replaces
        the notion of consistency with compatibility, and prove that MULSETPComp is
        NP-complete even when there are only two MUL-trees, every leaf label is used
        at most thrice, and every MUL-tree has constant height. Finally, we present
        a polynomial-time algorithm for instances of MULSETPC with a constant number
        of binary MUL-trees, in the special case where every leaf label occurs exactly
        once in at least one MUL-tree. 2012 ACM Subject Classification Theory of computation

        , a k-maximal subtree has at most one leaf whose degree is greater than 2
        and at least one leaf whose degree is at most 2. Furthermore, we show that
        a k-maximal subtree has a leaf of degree greater than 2 only when all its
        other leaves are leaves in T as well. In the second part, this paper introduces
        the local density as a normalization of local means, for the sake of comparing
        subtrees of different orders, and shows that the local density at subtree
        S is lower-bounded by 1/2 with equality if and only if S contains the core
        of T. On the other hand, local density can be arbitrarily close to 1.", "venue":

        problems of the proposed paper are generated by the actual tasks of communication
        networks. The development of communication resources is accompanied by an
        increase in the dimension of existing communication networks, for which the
        usual tools for solving network problems are becoming increasingly ineffective.At
        the same time, the spectrum of communication network problems covers both
        classical graph theory problems and specialized problems linking them with
        mathematical models of various fields of mathematics, including optimization
        theory, dynamic programming, probability theory and the theory of heuristic
        algorithms. This paper is devoted to the study of the problem of optimal allocation
        of a certain resource on the objects of the communication network. In this
        case, a complete set of specialized equipment at the nodes of the communication
        network is considered as a resource. It is necessary to optimize the number
        of pieces of equipment with the condition that all fiber-optic communication
        lines of the network are under the control of installed reflectometers. To
        solve this problem, variants of two methods were described: the greedy algorithm
        and the method of branches and boundaries. On the basis of the described algorithms,
        the computer programs were implemented and computational experiments were
        carried out; in the latter, the dimension of the communication network was
        chosen high enough to guarantee the legality of using the selected variants
        of algorithms for real communication networks. A representative series of
        experiments has shown that it is more expedient to use variants of the greedy
        heuristic algorithm for the group of problems under consideration, this paper
        contains a detailed argumentation\nof the result obtained. The considered
        problem can also be transferred to cases of optimal placement of other resources
        on the objects of the communication network. At the same time, if there is
        a specific objective function, there will be another formalization of restrictions.
        But the approaches to choosing the optimum may be identical, which makes the
        results obtained in the paper more important due to their participation in
        potential generalizations of the problem.", "venue": "Cybernetics and Physics",

        graph theory is the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used

        order and size of G is the number of vertices and edges of G, respectively.
        The degree or valency of a vertex u in a graph G (loopless), denoted by deg
        (u), is the number of edges meeting at u. If, for every vertex \u03bd in G,
        deg (\u03bd) = k, we say that G is a k-regular graph. The cycle of order n
        is denoted by Cn and is a connected 2-regular graph. The path graph of order
        n is denoted by Pn and obtain by deleting an edge of Cn. A tree is an undirected
        graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path, or equivalently
        a connected undirected graph without cycle. A leaf (or pendant vertex) of
        a tree is a vertex of the tree of degree 1. An edge of a graph is said to
        be pendant if one of its vertices is a pendant vertex. A complete bipartite

        problem of counting independent sets of a graph G, denoted by i(G). This problem
        has many applications in combinatorics, physics, chemistry and computer science.
        For example, in statistical physics, the computation of i(G) has been useful
        in studying the behavior of the particles of a gas on a space modeled by a
        grid structure. Regarding hard counting problems, the computation of i(G)
        for a graph G has been key to determining the frontier between efficient counting

        counting independent sets on grid-like structures is presented. We propose
        a novel algorithm for the computation of i(Gm,n) for a grid graph with m rows
        and n columns based on the \u2018Branch and Bound\u2019 design technique.
        The splitting rule in our proposal is based on the well-known vertex reduction
        rule. The vertex in any subgraph from Gm,n, which is to be selected for the
        reduction rule, must have four internal incident faces. The ramification process
        is used to build a computation tree. Our proposal consists of decomposing

        subgrids\u2019 associated with the leave nodes of the computation tree. The

        the Feedback Vertex Set and the Vertex Cover problem in a natural variant
        of the classical online model that allows for delayed decisions and reservations.
        Both problems can be characterized by an obstruction set of subgraphs that
        the online graph needs to avoid. In the case of the Vertex Cover problem,
        the obstruction set consists of an edge (i.e., the graph of two adjacent vertices),
        while for the Feedback Vertex Set problem, the obstruction set contains all
        cycles. In the delayed-decision model, an algorithm needs to maintain a valid
        partial solution after every request, thus allowing it to postpone decisions
        until the current partial solution is no longer valid for the current request.
        The reservation model grants an online algorithm the new and additional option
        to pay a so-called reservation cost for any given element in order to delay
        the decision of adding or rejecting it until the end of the instance. For
        the Feedback Vertex Set problem, we first analyze the variant with only delayed
        decisions, proving a lower bound of $4$ and an upper bound of $5$ on the competitive
        ratio. Then we look at the variant with both delayed decisions and reservation.
        We show that given bounds on the competitive ratio of a problem with delayed
        decisions impliy lower and upper bounds for the same problem when adding the
        option of reservations. This observation allows us to give a lower bound of
        $\\min{\\{1+3\\alpha,4\\}}$ and an upper bound of $\\min{\\{1+5\\alpha,5\\}}$
        for the Feedback Vertex Set problem. Finally, we show that the online Vertex
        Cover problem, when both delayed decisions and reservations are allowed, is
        $\\min{\\{1+2\\alpha, 2\\}}$-competitive, where $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq

        "We present a linear-time algorithm that, given as input (i) a bipartite Pfaffian
        graph $G$ of minimum degree three, (ii) a Hamiltonian cycle $H$ in $G$, and
        (iii) an edge $e$ in $H$, outputs at least three other Hamiltonian cycles
        through the edge $e$ in $G$. This linear-time complexity of finding another
        Hamiltonian cycle given one is in sharp contrast to the problem of deciding
        the existence of a Hamiltonian cycle, which is NP-complete already for cubic
        bipartite planar graphs; such graphs are Pfaffian. Also, without the degree
        requirement, we show that it is NP-hard to find another Hamiltonian cycle
        in a bipartite Pfaffian graph. We present further improved algorithms for
        finding optimal traveling salesperson tours and counting Hamiltonian cycles
        in bipartite planar graphs with running times that are not known to hold in
        general planar graphs. We prove our results by a new structural technique
        that efficiently witnesses each Hamiltonian cycle $H$ through an arbitrary
        fixed anchor edge $e$ in a bipartite Pfaffian graph using a two-coloring of
        the vertices as advice that is unique to $H$. Previous techniques -- the Cut&Count
        technique of Cygan et al. [FOCS''11, TALG''22] in particular -- were able
        to reduce the Hamiltonian cycle problem only to essentially counting problems;
        our results show that counting can be avoided by leveraging properties of
        bipartite Pfaffian graphs. Our technique also has purely graph-theoretical
        consequences; for example, we show that every cubic bipartite Pfaffian graph

        vertex-disjoint paths such that the $i$-th path connects $s_i$ to $t_i$. We
        study the problem through the lens of kernelization, aiming at efficiently

        V$, the cycle-degree of $v$ is the minimum size of a set $S \\subseteq V(D)
        \\setminus \\{v\\}$ intersecting every directed cycle of $D$ containing $v$.
        From this definition of cycle-degree, we define the $c$-degeneracy (or cycle-degeneracy)
        of $D$, which we denote by $\\delta^*_c(D)$. It appears to be a nice generalisation
        of the undirected degeneracy. In this work, using this new definition of cycle-degeneracy,
        we extend several evidences for Cereceda''s conjecture to digraphs. The $k$-dicolouring
        graph of $D$, denoted by $\\mathcal{D}_k(D)$, is the undirected graph whose
        vertices are the $k$-dicolourings of $D$ and in which two $k$-dicolourings
        are adjacent if they differ on the colour of exactly one vertex. We show that
        $\\mathcal{D}_k(D)$ has diameter at most $O_{\\delta^*_c(D)}(n^{\\delta^*_c(D)
        + 1})$ (respectively $O(n^2)$ and $(\\delta^*_c(D)+1)$) when $k$ is at least
        $\\delta^*_c(D)+2$ (respectively $\\frac{3}{2}(\\delta^*_c(D)+1)$ and $2(\\delta^*_c(D)+1)$).
        This improves known results on digraph redicolouring (Bousquet et al.). Next,
        we extend a result due to Feghali to digraphs, showing that $\\mathcal{D}_{d+1}(D)$
        has diameter at most $O_{d,\\epsilon}(n(\\log n)^{d-1})$ when $D$ has maximum
        average cycle-degree at most $d-\\epsilon$. We then show that two proofs of
        Bonamy and Bousquet for undirected graphs can be extended to digraphs. The
        first one uses the digrundy number of a digraph and the second one uses the
        $\\mathscr{D}$-width. Finally, we give a general theorem which makes a connection
        between the recolourability of a digraph $D$ and the recolourability of its
        underlying graph $UG(D)$. This result directly extends a number of results
        on planar graph recolouring to planar digraph redicolouring.", "venue": "arXiv.org",

        "title": "Balanced Separator Theorem for Unit Disk Graphs with Applications",
        "abstract": ". In this paper, we establish a novel balanced separator theorem
        for Unit Disk Graphs (UDGs) , which mimics the well-known Lipton and Tarjan\u2019s
        planar balanced shortest paths separator theorem. We prove that, in any n
        -vertex UDG G , one can \ufb01nd two hop-shortest paths P ( s, x ) and P (
        s, y ) such that the removal of the 3-hop-neighborhood of these paths (i.e.,
        N 3 G [ P ( s, x ) \u222a P ( s, y )]) from G leaves no connected component
        with more than 2 / 3 n vertices. This new balanced shortest-paths\u20143-hop-neighborhood
        separator theorem allows us to build, for any n -vertex UDG G , a system T
        ( G ) of at most 2 log 3 2 n + 2 spanning trees of G such that, for any two
        vertices x and y of G , there exists a tree T in T ( G ) with d T ( x, y )
        \u2264 3 \u00b7 d G ( x, y ) + 12. That is, the distances in any UDG can be
        approximately represented by the distances in at most 2 log 32 n + 2 of its
        spanning trees. Using these results, we propose a new compact and low delay
        routing labeling scheme for UDGs. They often model wireless ad hoc networks.
        We show that one can assign each vertex of an n -vertex UDG G a compact O
        (log 2 n )-bit label such that, given the label of a source vertex and the
        label of a destination, it is possible to compute e\ufb03ciently, based solely
        on these two labels, a neighbor of the source vertex that heads in the direction
        of the destination. We prove that this routing labeling scheme has a constant
        hop route-stretch (= hop delay ), i.e., for each two vertices x and y of G
        , it produces a routing path with h ( x, y ) hops (edges) such that h ( x,
        y ) \u2264 3 \u00b7 d G ( x, y ) + 12, where d G ( x, y ) is the hop distance
        between x and y in G . To the best of our knowledge, this is the \ufb01rst
        compact routing scheme for UDGs which not only guaranties delivery but has
        a low hop delay. It is easy to see that, for UDGs, a constant hop route-stretch
        implies a constant length route-stretch and a constant power route-stretch

        needed for a stack layout of a graph is called the stack number and the minimum
        number of stacks needed for a forest stack layout is called the forest stack
        number. We determine the forest stack number of some graphs and attack the
        conjecture that the forest stack number of graphs might be at most one greater
        than the stack number for every graph. For complete graphs, complete bipartite
        graphs Km,n with m \u226a n, planar 3-trees and k-trees the forest stack number
        or the best known bound on the forest stack number is shown to be the same
        as the stack number. For outerplanar graphs, one more stack is needed for
        forest stack layouts. We also show that for every k there is a graph with
        stack number k that needs k + 1 stacks for a forest stack layout. Assuming
        some restrictions apply, we find counterexamples to the conjecture. Deutsche
        Zusammenfassung Ein Stack Layout eines Graphen besteht aus einer Reihenfolge
        der Knoten \u03c3 und einer Partition, welche die Kanten in Stacks aufteilt.
        Keine zwei Kanten in einem Stack d\u00fcrfen sich kreuzen mit Bezug auf \u03c3.
        Das bedeutet, dass f\u00fcr keine zwei Kanten uv, xy in einem Stack mit \u03c3(u)
        < \u03c3(v) und \u03c3(x) < \u03c3(y) gelten darf, dass \u03c3(x) < \u03c3(u)
        < \u03c3(y) < \u03c3(v) oder \u03c3(u) < \u03c3(x) < \u03c3(v) < \u03c3(y).
        Bei Forest Stack Layouts muss der Graph auf jedem Stack zus\u00e4tzlich ein
        Wald sein. Die minimale Anzahl an Stacks, welche f\u00fcr ein Stack Layout
        eines Graphen ben\u00f6tigt werden, nennt sich die Stack Nummer und die minimale
        Anzahl an Stacks, welche f\u00fcr ein Forest Stack Layout eines Graphen ben\u00f6tigt
        werden, nennt sich die Forest Stack Nummer. Wir bestimmen die Forest Stack
        Nummer f\u00fcr einige Graphen und untersuchen die Vermutung, dass Forest
        Stack Layouts immer h\u00f6chstens einen Stack mehr ben\u00f6tigen als Stack
        Layouts eines Graphen. F\u00fcr vollst\u00e4ndige Graphen, vollst\u00e4ndige
        bipartite Graphen Km,n mit m \u226a n, planare 3-B\u00e4ume und k-B\u00e4ume
        zeigen wir, dass die Forest Stack Nummern bzw. die besten bekannten Schranken
        der Forest Stack Nummer die gleichen sind wie bei der Stack Nummer. F\u00fcr
        au\u00dfenplanare Graphen wird ein Stack mehr f\u00fcr ein Forest Stack Layout
        ben\u00f6tigt als f\u00fcr ein Stack Layout. Wir zeigen auch, dass f\u00fcr
        jedes k ein Graph mit Stack Nummer k und Forest Stack Nummer k + 1 existiert.
        Wenn wir zus\u00e4tzlich verschiedene Einschr\u00e4nkungen f\u00fcr die Layouts
        annehmen, finden wir Gegenbeispiele f\u00fcr die obige Vermutung.", "venue":

        of Geometric Shapes", "abstract": "Building on two recent models of [Almalki
        and Michail, 2022] and [Gupta et al., 2023], we explore the constructive power
        of a set of geometric growth processes. The studied processes, by applying
        a sequence of centralized, parallel, and linear-strength growth operations,
        can construct shapes from smaller shapes or from a singleton exponentially
        fast. A technical challenge in growing shapes that fast is the need to avoid
        collisions caused, for example, when the shape breaks, stretches, or self-intersects.
        We distinguish two types of growth operations -- one that avoids collisions
        by preserving cycles and one that achieves the same by breaking them -- and
        two types of graph models. We study the following types of shape reachability
        questions in these models. Given a class of initial shapes $\\mathcal{I}$
        and a class of final shapes $\\mathcal{F}$, our objective is to determine
        whether any (some) shape $S \\in \\mathcal{F}$ can be reached from any shape
        $S_0 \\in \\mathcal{I}$ in a number of time steps which is (poly)logarithmic
        in the size of $S$. For the reachable classes, we additionally present the
        respective growth processes. In cycle-preserving growth, we study these problems
        in basic classes of shapes such as paths, spirals, and trees and reveal the
        importance of the number of turning points as a parameter. We give both positive
        and negative results. For cycle-breaking growth, we obtain a strong positive

        Related Problems", "abstract": "A matching $M$ in a graph $G$ is an \\emph{acyclic
        matching} if the subgraph of $G$ induced by the endpoints of the edges of
        $M$ is a forest. Given a graph $G$ and a positive integer $\\ell$, Acyclic
        Matching asks whether $G$ has an acyclic matching of size (i.e., the number
        of edges) at least $\\ell$. In this paper, we first prove that assuming $\\mathsf{W[1]\\nsubseteq
        FPT}$, there does not exist any $\\mathsf{FPT}$-approximation algorithm for
        Acyclic Matching that approximates it within a constant factor when the parameter
        is the size of the matching. Our reduction is general in the sense that it
        also asserts $\\mathsf{FPT}$-inapproximability for Induced Matching and Uniquely
        Restricted Matching as well. We also consider three below-guarantee parameters
        for Acyclic Matching, viz. $\\frac{n}{2}-\\ell$, $\\mathsf{MM(G)}-\\ell$,
        and $\\mathsf{IS(G)}-\\ell$, where $n$ is the number of vertices in $G$, $\\mathsf{MM(G)}$
        is the matching number of $G$, and $\\mathsf{IS(G)}$ is the independence number
        of $G$. Furthermore, we show that Acyclic Matching does not exhibit a polynomial
        kernel with respect to vertex cover number (or vertex deletion distance to
        clique) plus the size of the matching unless $\\mathsf{NP}\\subseteq\\mathsf{coNP}\\slash\\mathsf{poly}$.",

        classical combinatorial problems have been considered and analysed on temporal

        has not been fully understood. The problem is known to be in FPT under the

        complexity for the general case is open. We settle this open problem by giving

        "The problem of strong edge coloring discusses assigning colors to the edges

        either adjacent to each other or are adjacent to a common edge. The least
        number of colors required to define a strong edge coloring of a graph is called
        its strong chromatic index. This problem is equivalent to the problem of assigning
        collision-free frequencies to the links between the elements of a wireless
        sensor network. In this article, we discuss a novel way of generating new
        graphs from existing graphs. This graph construction is known as inflating
        a graph. We discuss the strong chromatic index of graphs generated by inflating
        some common classes of graphs and graphs derived from them. In particular,
        we consider the cycle graph, which is symmetric in nature, and graphs such
        as the path graph and the star graph, which are not symmetric. Further, we

        "The maximum independent set problem is a classical NP-hard problem in theoretical
        computer science. In this work, we study a special case where the family of
        graphs considered is restricted to intersection graphs of sets of axis-aligned
        hyperrectangles and the input is provided in an online fashion. We prove bounds
        on the competitive ratio of an optimal online algorithm under the adaptive
        offline, adaptive online, and oblivious adversary models, for several classes
        of hyperrectangles and restrictions on the order of the input. We are the
        first to present results on this problem under the oblivious adversary model.
        We prove bounds on the competitive ratio for unit hypercubes, $\\sigma$-bounded
        hypercubes, unit-volume hypercubes, arbitrary hypercubes, and arbitrary hyperrectangles,
        in both arbitrary and non-dominated order. We are also the first to present
        results under the adaptive offline and adaptive online adversary models with
        input in non-dominated order, proving bounds on the competitive ratio for
        the same classes of hyperrectangles; for input in arbitrary order, we present
        the first results on $\\sigma$-bounded hypercubes, unit-volume hyperrectangles,
        arbitrary hypercubes, and arbitrary hyperrectangles. For input in dominating
        order, we show that the performance of the naive greedy algorithm matches
        the performance of an optimal offline algorithm in all cases. We also give
        lower bounds on the competitive ratio of a probabilistic greedy algorithm
        under the oblivious adversary model. We conclude by discussing several promising

        may be useful in the fields of chemistry, molecular science and computational
        drug discovery. As the problem is NP-complete, finding an optimal solution

        FPT run time. Lifting this result further to slightly more general graph classes,
        namely almost nowhere dense classes, where the size of depth-$r$ clique minors
        is subpolynomial, is impossible unless FPT=W[1]. On the other hand, in almost
        nowhere dense classes we can approximate such counting formulas with a small
        additive error. Note those counting formulas are contained in FOC({<}) but
        not FOC1(P). In particular, it follows that partial covering problems, such
        as partial dominating set, have fixed parameter algorithms on nowhere dense
        graph classes with almost linear running time.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year":

        "Exercise 2 Tournaments A tournament T = (V,A) is an oriented complete graph:
        for each pair of distinct vertices i and j in V , there is either an arc ij
        or ji (but not both). A tournament is strongly connected if for each pair
        of distinct vertices i and j in V , there is a directed path from i to j and
        a directed path from j to i. a. Prove or disprove: A strongly connected tournament
        on at least three vertices contains a directed triangle. (A directed triangle
        consists of the arcs ij, jk and ki where i, j and k are three distinct vertices.)",
