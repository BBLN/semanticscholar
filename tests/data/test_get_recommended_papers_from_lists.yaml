      "title": "Burning a binary tree and its generalization", "abstract": "Graph
      burning is a graph process that models the spread of social contagion. Initially,
      all the vertices of a graph G are unburnt. At each step, an unburnt vertex is
      put on fire and the fire from burnt vertices of the previous step spreads to
      their adjacent unburnt vertices. This process continues till all vertices are
      burnt. The burning number $b(G)$ of the graph $G$ is the minimum number of steps
      required to burn all the vertices in the graph. The burning number conjecture
      by Bonato et al. states that for a connected graph G of order n, its burning
      number $b(G) \\leq \\lceil \\sqrt{n} \\rceil$. It is easy to observe that in
      order to burn a graph it is enough to burn its spanning tree. Hence it suffices
      to prove that for any tree T of order n, its burning number $b(T) \\leq \\lceil
      \\sqrt{n} \\rceil$ where $T$ is the spanning tree of $G$. It was proved in 2018
      that $b(T) \\leq \\lceil \\sqrt{n + n_2 + 1/4} +1/2 \\rceil$ for a tree $T$
      where $n_2$ is the number of degree $2$ vertices in $T$. In this article, we
      give an algorithm to burn a tree and we improve the existing bound using this
      algorithm. We prove that $b(T)\\leq \\lceil \\sqrt{n + n_2 + 8}\\rceil -1$ which
      is an improved bound. Also, under certain restriction of degree $2$ vertices,
      we have improved upon the result of Bonato et al.(in 2021). We also provide

      "title": "The Unweighted and Weighted Reverse Shortest Path Problem for Disk
      Graphs", "abstract": "We study the reverse shortest path problem on disk graphs
      in the plane. In this problem we consider the proximity graph of a set of $n$
      disks in the plane of arbitrary radii: In this graph two disks are connected
      if the distance between them is at most some threshold parameter $r$. The case
      of intersection graphs is a special case with $r=0$. We give an algorithm that,
      given a target length $k$, computes the smallest value of $r$ for which there
      is a path of length at most $k$ between some given pair of disks in the proximity
      graph. Our algorithm runs in $O^*(n^{5/4})$ randomized expected time, which
      improves to $O^*(n^{6/5})$ for unit disk graphs, where all the disks have the
      same radius. Our technique is robust and can be applied to many variants of
      the problem. One significant variant is the case of weighted proximity graphs,
      where edges are assigned real weights equal to the distance between the disks
      or between their centers, and $k$ is replaced by a target weight $w$; that is,
      we seek a path whose length is at most $w$. In other variants, we want to optimize
      a parameter different from $r$, such as a scale factor of the radii of the disks.
      The main technique for the decision version of the problem (determining whether
      the graph with a given $r$ has the desired property) is based on efficient implementations
      of BFS (for the unweighted case) and of Dijkstra''s algorithm (for the weighted
      case), using efficient data structures for maintaining the bichromatic closest
      pair for certain bicliques and several distance functions. The optimization
      problem is then solved by combining the resulting decision procedure with enhanced
      variants of the interval shrinking and bifurcation technique of [4].", "venue":

      is one of the most difficult problems defined as NP-hard. In this problem, it
      is aimed to determine the important nodes that can influence all nodes via the
      minimum number of nodes on the graph. In this study, an efficient near-optimal
      algorithm showing a deterministic approach has been developed different from
      the approximation algorithms mentioned in the literature for discovering dominating
      set. The algorithm has O(n 3 ) time complexity in determining the Dominating
      Set (DS). At the same time, the algorithm is an original algorithm whose solution
      is not random by using a fundamental cut-set. The DS algorithm consists of 3
      basic phases. In the first phase of the algorithm, the algorithm that constructs
      the special spanning tree (Karci Max tree) of the graph is developed. In the
      second phase, the algorithm that finds the fundamental cut sets using the Kmax
      spanning tree is developed. In the last phase, Karci centrality node values
      are calculated with fundamental cut set and by using these Karci centrality
      node values, an algorithm has been developed to identify DS nodes. As a result
      of these three phases, the dominance values of the nodes on the graph and the
      DS nodes are calculated. The detected Karci centrality node values give priority

      problem: Given a graph $G$ and integers $k$ and $i \\le j$, find a set of at
      most $k$ vertices that intersects every (not necessarily induced) biclique $K_{i,
      j}$ in $G$. This is a natural generalization of the Bounded-Degree Deletion
      problem, wherein one asks whether there is a set of at most $k$ vertices whose
      deletion results in a graph of a given maximum degree $r$. The two problems
      coincide when $i = 1$ and $j = r + 1$. We show that Biclique-Free Vertex Deletion
      is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to $k + d$ for the degeneracy $d$
      by developing a $2^{O(d k^2)} \\cdot n^{O(1)}$-time algorithm. We also show
      that it can be solved in $2^{O(f k)} \\cdot n^{O(1)}$ time for the feedback
      vertex number $f$ when $i \\ge 2$. In contrast, we find that it is W[1]-hard
      for the treedepth for any integer $i \\ge 1$. Finally, we show that Biclique-Free
      Vertex Deletion has a polynomial kernel for every $i \\ge 1$ when parameterized
      by the feedback edge number. Previously, for this parameter, its fixed-parameter
      tractability for $i = 1$ was known [Betzler et al., DAM ''12] but the existence
      of polynomial kernel was open.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

      consisting of a source generating updates and $n$ nodes connected in a two-dimensional
      square grid. The source keeps updates of a process, that might be generated
      or observed, and shares them with the grid network. The nodes in the grid network
      communicate with their neighbors and disseminate these version updates using
      a push-style gossip strategy. We use the version age metric to quantify the
      timeliness of information at the nodes. We find an upper bound for the average
      version age for a set of nodes in a general network. Using this, we show that
      the average version age at a node scales as $O(n^{\\frac{1}{3}})$ in a grid
      network. Prior to our work, it has been known that when $n$ nodes are connected
      on a ring the version age scales as $O(n^{\\frac{1}{2}})$, and when they are
      connected on a fully-connected graph the version age scales as $O(\\log n)$.
      Ours is the first work to show an age scaling result for a connectivity structure
      other than the ring and fully-connected networks that represent two extremes
      of network connectivity. Our work shows that higher connectivity on a grid compared
      to a ring lowers the age experience of each node from $O(n^{\\frac{1}{2}})$

      labeling scheme} for a given class of graphs is an algorithm that for every
      graph $G$ from the class, assigns bit strings (labels) to vertices of $G$ so
      that for any two vertices $u,v$, whether $u$ and $v$ are adjacent can be determined
      by a fixed procedure that examines only their labels. It is known that planar
      graphs with $n$ vertices admit a labeling scheme with labels of bit length $(2+o(1))\\log{n}$.
      In this work we improve this bound by designing a labeling scheme with labels
      of bit length $(\\frac{4}{3}+o(1))\\log{n}$. In graph-theoretical terms, this
      implies an explicit construction of a graph on $n^{4/3+o(1)}$ vertices that
      contains all planar graphs on $n$ vertices as induced subgraphs, improving the
      previous best upper bound of $n^{2+o(1)}$. Our scheme generalizes to graphs
      of bounded Euler genus with the same label length up to a second-order term.

      is to find a sequence of nodes from $V$, called a burning sequence, to burn
      the whole graph. This is a discrete-step process, and at each step, an unburned
      vertex is selected as an agent to spread fire to its neighbors by marking it
      as a burnt node. A burnt node spreads the fire to its neighbors at the next
      consecutive step. The goal is to find the burning sequence of minimum length.
      The Graph Burning problem is NP-Hard for general graphs and even for binary
      trees. A few approximation results are known, including a $ 3$-approximation
      algorithm for general graphs and a $ 2$-approximation algorithm for trees. The
      Graph Burning on directed graphs is more challenging than on undirected graphs.
      In this paper, we propose 1) A $2.75$-approximation algorithm for a cactus graph
      (undirected), 2) A $3$-approximation algorithm for multi-rooted directed trees
      (polytree) and 3) A $1.905$-approximation algorithm for single-rooted directed

      "abstract": "A graph G is a k-leaf power, for an integer k>= 2, if there is
      a tree T with leaf set V(G) such that, for all vertices x, y in V(G), the edge
      xy exists in G if and only if the distance between x and y in T is at most k.
      Such a tree T is called a k-leaf root of G. The computational problem of constructing
      a k-leaf root for a given graph G and an integer k, if any, is motivated by
      the challenge from computational biology to reconstruct phylogenetic trees.
      For fixed k, Lafond [SODA 2022] recently solved this problem in polynomial time.
      In this paper, we propose to study optimal leaf roots of graphs G, that is,
      the k-leaf roots of G with minimum k value. Thus, all k''-leaf roots of G satisfy
      k<= k''. In terms of computational biology, seeking optimal leaf roots is more
      justified as they yield more probable phylogenetic trees. Lafond''s result does
      not imply polynomial-time computability of optimal leaf roots, because, even
      for optimal k-leaf roots, k may (exponentially) depend on the size of G. This
      paper presents a linear-time construction of optimal leaf roots for chordal
      cographs (also known as trivially perfect graphs). Additionally, it highlights
      the importance of the parity of the parameter k and provides a deeper insight

      is an unrooted binary tree whose leaves are bijectively labelled by $X$. Such
      trees can be used to show the way species evolve over time. One way of understanding
      how topologically different two phylogenetic trees are, is to construct a minimum-size
      agreement forest: a partition of $X$ into the smallest number of blocks, such
      that the blocks induce homeomorphic, non-overlapping subtrees in both trees.
      This comparison yields insight into commonalities and differences in the evolution
      of $X$ across the two trees. Computing a smallest agreement forest is NP-hard
      (Hein, Jiang, Wang and Zhang, Discrete Applied Mathematics 71(1-3), 1996). In
      this work we study the problem on caterpillars, which are path-like phylogenetic
      trees. We will demonstrate that, even if we restrict the input to this highly
      restricted subclass, the problem remains NP-hard and is in fact APX-hard. Furthermore
      we show that for caterpillars two standard reductions rules well known in the

      general trees (Kelk and Simone, SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics 33(3),

      an agreement forest with at most $k$ blocks in $O^*(2.49^k)$ time, compared
      to $O^*(3^k)$ for general trees (Chen, Fan and Sze, Theoretical Computater Science

      "abstract": "Over the past decade, a long line of research has investigated
      the distributed complexity landscape of locally checkable labeling (LCL) problems
      on bounded-degree graphs, culminating in an almost-complete classification on
      general graphs and a complete classification on trees. The latter states that,
      on bounded-degree trees, any LCL problem has deterministic \\emph{worst-case}

      for some positive integer $k$, and all of those complexity classes are nonempty.
      Moreover, randomness helps only for (some) problems with deterministic worst-case
      complexity $\\Theta(\\log n)$, and if randomness helps (asymptotically), then
      it helps exponentially. In this work, we study how many distributed rounds are
      needed \\emph{on average per node} in order to solve an LCL problem on trees.
      We obtain a partial classification of the deterministic \\emph{node-averaged}
      complexity landscape for LCL problems. As our main result, we show that every
      problem with worst-case round complexity $O(\\log n)$ has deterministic node-averaged

      whereas as graph classes we consider $K_{t,t}$-subgraph-free graphs, line graphs
      and their common superclass, for $t \\geq 3$, of $K_{t,t}$-free graphs. We first
      provide a complete comparison when restricted to $K_{t,t}$-subgraph-free graphs,
      showing in particular that treewidth, clique-width, mim-width, sim-width and
      tree-independence number are all equivalent. This extends a result of Gurski

      the class of $K_{t,t}$-subgraph-free graphs. Next, we provide a complete comparison

      "We develop the theory of $k$-cores in hypergraphs based on the assumption that
      a hyperedge can only be intact if all its nodes are undamaged. This scenario
      applies for instance to supply chains where the production of a product requires
      all raw materials and all processing steps; in biology it applies to protein-interaction
      networks where protein complexes can only function if all the proteins are present,
      and it applies as well to chemical reaction networks where a chemical reaction
      can take place only when all the reactants are present. Formulating a message-passing
      theory for hypergraph $k$-core percolation, and combining it with the theory
      of critical phenomena on networks we demonstrate that the set of $k$-core problems
      for locally tree-like hypergraphs is much richer than for ordinary graphs. In
      particular we define a pruning process acting on nodes as well as on hyperedges
      depending on their connectivity and we demonstrate sharp differences with previously
      studied factor graph $k$-core percolation processes where it is allow for hyperedges
      to have one or more damaged nodes and still be intact. Furthermore we define
      a set of pruning processes that act either exclusively on nodes or exclusively
      on hyperedges and depend of their second-neighborhood connectivity. We show
      that the resulting second-neighbor $k$-core percolation problems are significantly
      distinct with each other and we reveal their relation to hypergraph and factor

      Matters", "abstract": "Let $G$ be a graph, which represents a social network,
      and suppose each node $v$ has a threshold value $\\tau(v)$. Consider an initial
      configuration, where each node is either positive or negative. In each discrete
      time step, a node $v$ becomes/remains positive if at least $\\tau(v)$ of its
      neighbors are positive and negative otherwise. A node set $\\mathcal{S}$ is
      a Target Set (TS) whenever the following holds: if $\\mathcal{S}$ is fully positive
      initially, all nodes in the graph become positive eventually. We focus on a
      generalization of TS, called Timed TS (TTS), where it is permitted to assign
      a positive state to a node at any step of the process, rather than just at the
      beginning. We provide graph structures for which the minimum TTS is significantly
      smaller than the minimum TS, indicating that timing is an essential aspect of
      successful target selection strategies. Furthermore, we prove tight bounds on
      the minimum size of a TTS in terms of the number of nodes and maximum degree
      when the thresholds are assigned based on the majority rule. We show that the
      problem of determining the minimum size of a TTS is NP-hard and provide an Integer

      Finding paths is a fundamental problem in graph theory and algorithm design
      due to its many applications. Recently, this problem has been considered on
      temporal graphs, where edges may change over a discrete time domain. The analysis
      of graphs has also taken into account the relevance of vertex properties, modeled
      by assigning to vertices labels or colors. In this work, we deal with a problem
      that, given a static or temporal graph, whose vertices are colored graph looks
      for a path such that (1) the vertices of the path have distinct colors and (2)
      that path includes the maximum number of colors. We analyze the approximation
      complexity of the problem on static and temporal graphs, and we prove an inapproximability
      bound. Then, we consider the problem on temporal graphs, and we design a heuristic
      for it. We present an experimental evaluation of our heuristic, both on synthetic
      and real-world graphs. The experimental results show that for many instances
      of the problem, our method is able to return near-optimal solutions.", "venue":

      the models and assessing the optimality of paths become more complicated. Hence,
      multiple recent publications in the field adapt existing labeling methods in
      an ad-hoc fashion to their specific problem variant without considering the
      underlying general structure: they always deal with multi-criteria scenarios
      and those criteria define different partial orders on the paths. In this paper,
      we introduce the partial order shortest path problem (POSP), a generalization
      of the multi-objective shortest path problem (MOSP) and in turn also of the
      classical shortest path problem. POSP captures the particular structure of many
      shortest path applications as special cases. In this generality, we study optimality
      conditions or the lack of them, depending on the objective functions'' properties.
      Our final contribution is a big lookup table summarizing our findings and providing
      the reader an easy way to choose among the most recent multicriteria shortest

      from time-dependent shortest path and bottleneck path problems to the fuzzy

      "Clustering a graph when the clusters can overlap can be seen from three different
      angles: We may look for cliques that cover the edges of the graph, we may look
      to add or delete few edges to uncover the cluster structure, or we may split
      vertices to separate the clusters from each other. Splitting a vertex $v$ means
      to remove it and to add two new copies of $v$ and to make each previous neighbor
      of $v$ adjacent with at least one of the copies. In this work, we study the
      underlying computational problems regarding the three angles to overlapping
      clusterings, in particular when the overlap is small. We show that the above-mentioned
      covering problem, which also has been independently studied in different contexts,is
      NP-complete. Based on a previous so-called critical-clique lemma, we leverage
      our hardness result to show that Cluster Editing with Vertex Splitting is also
      NP-complete, resolving an open question by Abu-Khzam et al. [ISCO 2018]. We
      notice, however, that the proof of the critical-clique lemma is flawed and we
      give a counterexample. Our hardness result also holds under a version of the

      the edge $e$ in $G$. This linear-time complexity of finding another Hamiltonian
      cycle given one is in sharp contrast to the problem of deciding the existence
      of a Hamiltonian cycle, which is NP-complete already for cubic bipartite planar
      graphs; such graphs are Pfaffian. Also, without the degree requirement, we show
      that it is NP-hard to find another Hamiltonian cycle in a bipartite Pfaffian
      graph. We present further improved algorithms for finding optimal traveling
      salesperson tours and counting Hamiltonian cycles in bipartite planar graphs
      with running times that are not known to hold in general planar graphs. We prove
      our results by a new structural technique that efficiently witnesses each Hamiltonian
      cycle $H$ through an arbitrary fixed anchor edge $e$ in a bipartite Pfaffian
      graph using a two-coloring of the vertices as advice that is unique to $H$.
      Previous techniques -- the Cut&Count technique of Cygan et al. [FOCS''11, TALG''22]
      in particular -- were able to reduce the Hamiltonian cycle problem only to essentially
      counting problems; our results show that counting can be avoided by leveraging
      properties of bipartite Pfaffian graphs. Our technique also has purely graph-theoretical
      consequences; for example, we show that every cubic bipartite Pfaffian graph
      has either zero or at least six distinct Hamiltonian cycles; the latter case
      is tight for the cube graph.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

      perspectives. Based on this, the enumeration of patterns is performed through
      a new lossless compression scheme for trees, called DAG-RW, whose complexity
      is investigated as well. The method shows very good properties, both in terms
      of computation times and analysis of real datasets from the literature. Compared

      "The twin-width of a graph measures its distance to co-graphs and generalizes
      classical width concepts such as tree-width or rank-width. Since its introduction
      in 2020 (Bonnet et. al. 2020), a mass of new results has appeared relating twin
      width to group theory, model theory, combinatorial optimization, and structural
      graph theory. We take a detailed look at the interplay between the twin-width
      of a graph and the twin-width of its components under tree-structured decompositions:
      We prove that the twin-width of a graph is at most twice its strong tree-width,
      contrasting nicely with the result of (Bonnet and D\\''epr\\''es 2022), which
      states that twin-width can be exponential in tree-width. Further, we employ
      the fundamental concept from structural graph theory of decomposing a graph
      into highly connected components, in order to obtain an optimal linear bound
      on the twin-width of a graph given the widths of its biconnected components.
      For triconnected components we obtain a linear upper bound if we add red edges
      to the components indicating the splits which led to the components. Extending
      this approach to quasi-4-connectivity, we obtain a quadratic upper bound. Finally,
      we investigate how the adhesion of a tree decomposition influences the twin-width
      of the decomposed graph.", "venue": "", "year": 2023, "referenceCount": 17,

      "title": "Balanced Separator Theorem for Unit Disk Graphs with Applications",
      "abstract": ". In this paper, we establish a novel balanced separator theorem
      for Unit Disk Graphs (UDGs) , which mimics the well-known Lipton and Tarjan\u2019s
      planar balanced shortest paths separator theorem. We prove that, in any n -vertex
      UDG G , one can \ufb01nd two hop-shortest paths P ( s, x ) and P ( s, y ) such
      that the removal of the 3-hop-neighborhood of these paths (i.e., N 3 G [ P (
      s, x ) \u222a P ( s, y )]) from G leaves no connected component with more than
      2 / 3 n vertices. This new balanced shortest-paths\u20143-hop-neighborhood separator
      theorem allows us to build, for any n -vertex UDG G , a system T ( G ) of at
      most 2 log 3 2 n + 2 spanning trees of G such that, for any two vertices x and
      y of G , there exists a tree T in T ( G ) with d T ( x, y ) \u2264 3 \u00b7
      d G ( x, y ) + 12. That is, the distances in any UDG can be approximately represented
      by the distances in at most 2 log 32 n + 2 of its spanning trees. Using these
      results, we propose a new compact and low delay routing labeling scheme for
      UDGs. They often model wireless ad hoc networks. We show that one can assign
      each vertex of an n -vertex UDG G a compact O (log 2 n )-bit label such that,
      given the label of a source vertex and the label of a destination, it is possible
      to compute e\ufb03ciently, based solely on these two labels, a neighbor of the
      source vertex that heads in the direction of the destination. We prove that
      this routing labeling scheme has a constant hop route-stretch (= hop delay ),
      i.e., for each two vertices x and y of G , it produces a routing path with h
      ( x, y ) hops (edges) such that h ( x, y ) \u2264 3 \u00b7 d G ( x, y ) + 12,
      where d G ( x, y ) is the hop distance between x and y in G . To the best of
      our knowledge, this is the \ufb01rst compact routing scheme for UDGs which not
      only guaranties delivery but has a low hop delay. It is easy to see that, for
      UDGs, a constant hop route-stretch implies a constant length route-stretch and
      a constant power route-stretch .", "venue": "", "year": 2008, "referenceCount":

      "The diameter of a tree is a measure of the longest path between any two nodes
      in the tree where this path is defined in terms of the number of edges. A Diameter-Constrained
      Minimum Spanning Tree (DCMST) is a minimum-weight spanning tree with a diameter
      less than a given integer. Finding a DCMST is an NP-complete problem, and it
      may require searching through all possible spanning trees with acceptable diameters
      and finding the minimum. There have been a number of algorithms proposed for
      finding a DCMST efficiently. These algorithms can be broadly classified into
      two categories: exact algorithms and approximate algorithms. Exact algorithms
      are able to find the exact DCMST but generally have a higher time complexity
      and they are not suitable for very large trees. Approximate algorithms, on the
      other hand, are able to find an approximate DCMST, but may not be as accurate
      as the exact algorithms. In this survey, we review various algorithms that have
      been proposed for solving the DCMST problem and compare their performance in
      terms of time complexity, accuracy, and other relevant factors. Over-all, the
      problem of finding the DCMST is an active area of research, and there is still

      problems on directed graphs: Hamiltonian Cycle and its generalization {\\sc
      Longest Cycle}. Since 2008, it is known that Hamiltonian Cycle is W[1]-hard
      when parameterized by directed treewidth [Lampis et al., ISSAC''08]. By now,
      the question of whether it is FPT parameterized by the directed feedback vertex
      set (DFVS) number has become a longstanding open problem. In particular, the
      DFVS number is the largest natural directed width measure studied in the literature.
      In this paper, we provide a negative answer to the question, showing that even
      for the DFVS number, the problem remains W[1]-hard. As a consequence, we also
      obtain that Longest Cycle is W[1]-hard on directed graphs when parameterized
      multiplicatively above girth, in contrast to the undirected case. This resolves
      an open question posed by Fomin et al. [ACM ToCT''21] and Gutin and Mnich [arXiv:2207.12278].

      we are given an $n$-node, $m$-edge input graph $G$, and the goal is to compute
      a spanning subgraph $H$ on $O(n)$ edges. This can be achieved in linear $O(m
      + n)$ time via breadth-first search. But can we hope for \\emph{sublinear} runtime
      in some range of parameters? If the goal is to return $H$ as an adjacency list,
      there are simple lower bounds showing that $\\Omega(m + n)$ runtime is necessary.
      If the goal is to return $H$ as an adjacency matrix, then we need $\\Omega(n^2)$
      time just to write down the entries of the output matrix. However, we show that
      neither of these lower bounds still apply if instead the goal is to return $H$
      as an \\emph{implicit} adjacency matrix, which we call an \\emph{adjacency oracle}.
      An adjacency oracle is a data structure that gives a user the illusion that
      an adjacency matrix has been computed: it accepts edge queries $(u, v)$, and
      it returns in near-constant time a bit indicating whether $(u, v) \\in E(H)$.
      Our main result is that one can construct an adjacency oracle for a spanning
      subgraph on at most $(1+\\varepsilon)n$ edges, in $\\tilde{O}(n \\varepsilon^{-1})$
      time, and that this construction time is near-optimal. Additional results include
      constructions of adjacency oracles for $k$-connectivity certificates and spanners,
      which are similarly sublinear on dense-enough input graphs. Our adjacency oracles
      are closely related to Local Computation Algorithms (LCAs) for graph sparsifiers;
      they can be viewed as LCAs with some computation moved to a preprocessing step,
      in order to speed up queries. Our oracles imply the first Local algorithm for
      computing sparse spanning subgraphs of general input graphs in $\\tilde{O}(n)$

      the structure of many crystals and minerals. It consists of four cubic lattices.
      It is supposed that there are two types of steps between two grid points. It
      is possible to step to one of the nearest neighbors of the same cubic lattice
      (type 1) or to step to one of the nearest neighbors of another cubic lattice
      (type 2). Steps belonging to the same type have the same length (weight). However,
      the two types have different lengths and thus may have different weights. This
      paper discusses the minimal path between any two points of the f.c.c. grid.
      The minimal paths are explicitly given, i.e. to obtain a minimal path one is
      required to perform only O(1) computations. The mathematical problem can be
      the model of different spreading phenomena in crystals having the f.c.c. structure.",

      "abstract": "We consider the Shortest Odd Path problem, where given an undirected
      graph $G$, a weight function on its edges, and two vertices $s$ and $t$ in $G$,
      the aim is to find an $(s,t)$-path with odd length and, among all such paths,
      of minimum weight. For the case when the weight function is conservative, i.e.,
      when every cycle has non-negative total weight, the complexity of the Shortest
      Odd Path problem had been open for 20 years, and was recently shown to be NP-hard.
      We give a polynomial-time algorithm for the special case when the weight function
      is conservative and the set $E^-$ of negative-weight edges forms a single tree.
      Our algorithm exploits the strong connection between Shortest Odd Path and the
      problem of finding two internally vertex-disjoint paths between two terminals
      in an undirected edge-weighted graph. It also relies on solving an intermediary
      problem variant called Shortest Parity-Constrained Odd Path where for certain
      edges we have parity constraints on their position along the path. Also, we
      exhibit two FPT algorithms for solving Shortest Odd Path in graphs with conservative
      weight functions. The first FPT algorithm is parameterized by $|E^-|$, the number
      of negative edges, or more generally, by the maximum size of a matching in the
      subgraph of $G$ spanned by $E^-$. Our second FPT algorithm is parameterized
      by the treewidth of $G$.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

      Subgraph problem is to find the largest subgraph common to two given graphs.
      This problem finds applications in a wide variety of fields, for example it
      can be utilized to find common substructures between two molecules, which may
      be useful in the fields of chemistry, molecular science and computational drug
      discovery. As the problem is NP-complete, finding an optimal solution requires
      exhaustively exploring the solution space. Various different approaches have
      been applied to the Maximum Common Subgraph problem, such as reducing it to
      the Maximum Clique or Minimum Vertex-Cover problems, applying Constraint-Satisfaction
      Programming or utilizing a partitioning approach. We propose two methods of
      data reduction, which may be used to reduce the sizes of the input graphs and
      can thus simplify the problem. Additionally, we propose two methods of computing
      upper bounds, as means to terminate the search for solutions as soon as the
      best solution found matches the upper bound. We explore the exploitation of
      symmetries, as to reduce the search space which needs to be explored, and we
      evaluate an Independent Set solver as an alternative solver. Finally, we extensively
      evaluate existing approaches and our techniques experimentally, where we show
      that a heuristic independent set solver may significantly outperform existing
      approaches both in terms of running time as well as result quality, given a
      maximum execution time per problem instance. We additionally introduce a pre-processing
