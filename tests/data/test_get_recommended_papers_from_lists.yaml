      the minimum cardinalities of such sets in general or to establish bounds on
      these minimum cardinalities in special graph classes. In this paper, we study
      the minimum cardinalities of these variants of the dominating set under a graph

      graph, the unlabeled subgraphs $G-v$ are called the cards of $G$ and the deck
      of $G$ is the multiset $\\{G-v: v \\in V(G)\\}$. Wendy Myrvold [Ars Combinatoria,
      1989] showed that a non-connected graph and a connected graph both on $n$ vertices
      have at most $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor +1$ cards in common and she found
      (infinite) families of trees and non-connected forests for which this upper
      bound is tight. Bowler, Brown, and Fenner [Journal of Graph Theory, 2010] conjectured
      that this bound is tight for $n \\geq 44$. In this article, we prove this conjecture
      for sufficiently large $n$. The main result is that a tree $T$ and a unicyclic
      graph $G$ on $n$ vertices have at most $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor+1$ common
      cards. Combined with Myrvold''s work this shows that it can be determined whether
      a graph on $n$ vertices is a tree from any $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2}\\rfloor+1$
      of its cards. Based on this theorem, it follows that any forest and non-forest
      also have at most $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor +1$ common cards. Moreover,
      we have classified all except finitely many pairs for which this bound is strict.
      Furthermore, the main ideas of the proof for trees are used to show that the
      girth of a graph on $n$ vertices can be determined based on any $\\frac{2n}{3}

      "We study a new graph separation problem called Multiway Near-Separator. Given
      an undirected graph $G$, integer $k$, and terminal set $T \\subseteq V(G)$,
      it asks whether there is a vertex set $S \\subseteq V(G) \\setminus T$ of size
      at most $k$ such that in graph $G-S$, no pair of distinct terminals can be connected
      by two pairwise internally vertex-disjoint paths. Hence each terminal pair can
      be separated in $G-S$ by removing at most one vertex. The problem is therefore
      a generalization of (Node) Multiway Cut, which asks for a vertex set for which
      each terminal is in a different component of $G-S$. We develop a fixed-parameter
      tractable algorithm for Multiway Near-Separator running in time $2^{O(k \\log
      k)} * n^{O(1)}$. Our algorithm is based on a new pushing lemma for solutions
      with respect to important separators, along with two problem-specific ingredients.
      The first is a polynomial-time subroutine to reduce the number of terminals
      in the instance to a polynomial in the solution size $k$ plus the size of a
      given suboptimal solution. The second is a polynomial-time algorithm that, given
      a graph $G$ and terminal set $T \\subseteq V(G)$ along with a single vertex
      $x \\in V(G)$ that forms a multiway near-separator, computes a 14-approximation

      "The weighted ancestor problem on a rooted node-weighted tree $T$ is a generalization
      of the classic predecessor problem: construct a data structure for a set of
      integers that supports fast predecessor queries. Both problems are known to
      require $\\Omega(\\log\\log n)$ time for queries provided $\\mathcal{O}(n\\text{
      poly} \\log n)$ space is available, where $n$ is the input size. The weighted
      ancestor problem has attracted a lot of attention by the combinatorial pattern
      matching community due to its direct application to suffix trees. In this formulation
      of the problem, the nodes are weighted by string depth. This attention has culminated
      in a data structure for weighted ancestors in suffix trees with $\\mathcal{O}(1)$
      query time and an $\\mathcal{O}(n)$-time construction algorithm [Belazzougui
      et al., CPM 2021]. In this paper, we consider a different version of the weighted
      ancestor problem, where the nodes are weighted by any function $\\textsf{weight}$
      that maps the nodes of $T$ to positive integers, such that $\\textsf{weight}(u)\\le
      \\textsf{size}(u)$ for any node $u$ and $\\textsf{weight}(u_1)\\le \\textsf{weight}(u_2)$
      if node $u_1$ is a descendant of node $u_2$, where $\\textsf{size}(u)$ is the
      number of nodes in the subtree rooted at $u$. In the size-constrained weighted
      ancestor (SWAQ) problem, for any node $u$ of $T$ and any integer $k$, we are
      asked to return the lowest ancestor $w$ of $u$ with weight at least $k$. We
      show that for any rooted tree with $n$ nodes, we can locate node $w$ in $\\mathcal{O}(1)$
      time after $\\mathcal{O}(n)$-time preprocessing. In particular, this implies
      a data structure for the SWAQ problem in suffix trees with $\\mathcal{O}(1)$
      query time and $\\mathcal{O}(n)$-time preprocessing, when the nodes are weighted
      by $\\textsf{weight}$. We also show several string-processing applications of

      dominating set is a graph problem that asks for the smallest subset of vertices

      "This paper aims at finding node-disjoint paths in multi-domain networks while

      shortest node-disjoint paths for every pair of aggregated links. This information
      is then utilized on the inter-domain aggregated topology for the computation
      of two node-disjoint paths with minimum cost for every demand in the network.
      Four approaches are proposed and evaluated in terms of average cost per demand
      and blocking probability. Their performance is also compared to the respective
      approaches for link-disjoint routing. Two of the proposed node-disjoint routing

      is the problem of finding a minimal set of edge modifications to transform a
      given graph into a cluster graph - a graph whose connected components are cliques.
      A set of induced, vertex pair disjoint paths of length two in the given graph
      is a lower bound for the number of required edge modifications. To find such
      sets, we define and examine a type of intersection graph, the P 3 - intersection
      graph , that models which induced paths of length two, called P 3 s, in a given
      graph share a vertex pair. Now, any independent set on the P 3 -intersection
      graph yields a lower bound for the Cluster Editing problem on the given graph.
      Unfortunately, Maximum Independent Set generally is NP-hard. However, the complexity
      on P 3 -intersection graphs is unknown. In this work, we show that the neighbourhood
      of every vertex in a P 3 -intersection graph can be partitioned into three cliques
      characterized by which vertex pair the contained vertices share with the respective
      vertex. We also prove that edges between these cliques strictly follow a specific

      NP-hardness of Maximum Independent Set on P 3 -intersection graphs. Finally,

      "A non-crossing spanning tree of a set of points in the plane is a spanning
      tree whose edges pairwise do not cross. Avis and Fukuda in 1996 proved that
      there always exists a flip sequence of length at most $2n-4$ between any pair
      of non-crossing spanning trees (where $n$ denotes the number of points). Hernando
      et al. proved that the length of a minimal flip sequence can be of length at
      least $\\frac 32 n$. Two recent results of Aichholzer et al. and Bousquet et
      al. improved the Avis and Fukuda upper bound by proving that there always exists
      a flip sequence of length respectively at most $2n - \\log n$ and $2n - \\sqrt{n}$.
      We improve the upper bound by a linear factor for the first time in 25 years
      by proving that there always exists a flip sequence between any pair of non-crossing
      spanning trees $T_1,T_2$ of length at most $c n$ where $c \\approx 1.95$. Our
      result is actually stronger since we prove that, for any two trees $T_1,T_2$,
      there exists a flip sequence from $T_1$ to $T_2$ of length at most $c |T_1 \\setminus
      T_2|$. We also improve the best lower bound in terms of the symmetric difference
      by proving that there exists a pair of trees $T_1,T_2$ such that a minimal flip
      sequence has length $\\frac 53 |T_1 \\setminus T_2|$, improving the lower bound
      of Hernando et al. by considering the symmetric difference instead of the number
      of vertices. We generalize this lower bound construction to non-crossing flips

      O(1.9140^n) [ShimizuM22] and for Set Cover with a small number of sets with
      running time O(1.7274^n |F|^O(1)) [AmbainisBIKPV19]. In this paper, we give
      a quantum speedup for Set Partition, Set Cover, and Set Packing whenever there
      is a classical enumeration algorithm that lends itself to a quadratic quantum
      speedup, which, for any subinstance on a subset X of U, enumerates at least
      one member of a k-partition, k-cover, or k-packing (if one exists) restricted
      to (or projected onto, in the case of k-cover) the set X in O*(c^{|X|}) time
      with c<2. Our bounded-error quantum algorithm runs in O*((2+c)^(n/2)) for Set
      Partition, Set Cover, and Set Packing. When c<=1.147899, our algorithm is slightly
      faster than O*((2+c)^(n/2)); when c approaches 1, it matches the running time
      of [AmbainisBIKPV19] for Set Cover when |F| is subexponential in n. For Graph
      Coloring, we further improve the running time to O(1.7956^n) by leveraging faster
      algorithms for coloring with a small number of colors to better balance our
      divide-and-conquer steps. For Domatic Number, we obtain a O((2-\\epsilon)^n)
      running time for some \\epsilon>0.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

      "title": "A Universal Scheme for Partitioned Dynamic Shortest Path Index", "abstract":
      "Graph partitioning is a common solution to scale up the graph algorithms, and
      shortest path (SP) computation is one of them. However, the existing solutions
      typically have a fixed partition method with a fixed path index and fixed partition
      structure, so it is unclear how the partition method and path index influence
      the pathfinding performance. Moreover, few studies have explored the index maintenance
      of partitioned SP (PSP) on dynamic graphs. To provide a deeper insight into
      the dynamic PSP indexes, we systematically deliberate on the existing works
      and propose a universal scheme to analyze this problem theoretically. Specifically,
      we first propose two novel partitioned index strategies and one optimization
      to improve index construction, query answering, or index maintenance of PSP
      index. Then we propose a path-oriented graph partitioning classification criteria
      for easier partition method selection. After that, we re-couple the dimensions

      Minimum Clique Routing Problem on Cycles \\textsc{MCRPC} we are given a cycle

      is to route all the pairs minimizing the maximum weighted clique of the intersection
      graph induced by the routing. The vertices of this graph are the demands with
      their corresponding weights and two demands are adjacent when their routes share
      at least one arc. In this work we are not only interested in the \\textsc{MCRPC}

      the demands are disjoint, in the sense that every two demands do not share any
      of their corresponding ends. Second, we analyze the subproblem where the weights
      of the routes are all equal. We first show that the problem is NP-complete even
      in the subproblem of disjoint demands. For the case of arbitrary weights, we
      exhibit a simple combinatorial 2-approximation algorithm and a $\\frac{3}{2}$-approximation
      algorithm based on rounding a solution of a relaxation of an integer linear
      programming formulation of our problem. Finally, we give a Fixed Parameter Tractable

      "title": "Locally Checkable Labeling Problems in Rooted Trees in the Online-LOCAL
      Model of Computation", "abstract": "There are many ways to classify algorithms.
      Online algorithms, for example, are algorithms that have to be able to handle
      input one element at a time. Offline algorithms, on the other hand, have access
      to the whole input. In the case of online graph algorithms, the structure of
      the underlying graph is fixed. The graph is revealed to the algorithm one node
      at a time. When a node is revealed, the algorithm has to decide its output for
      that node, and it cannot change its decision later. Another way to classify
      algorithms is to divide them into centralized and distributed algorithms. In
      the case of graph algorithms, a centralized algorithm is a completely separate
      entity from the graph. When the nodes (or edges) of the graph are active parties
      in the execution of the algorithm, the algorithm is called a distributed algorithm.
      One commonly used model of distributed computation is the LOCAL model. In the
      LOCAL model, all nodes are computing their own part of the result in parallel.
      The nodes only see their own local neighborhood and need to base their decision
      only on this local view. In this thesis, I introduce the online-LOCAL model,
      which combines the power of online graph algorithms and LOCAL algorithms. Like
      online graph algorithms, online-LOCAL algorithms need to react to nodes being
      revealed one at a time. Unlike online graph algorithms, online-LOCAL algorithms
      also get to see the local neighborhood around the nodes before needing to make
      their decisions. The online-LOCAL model is a very strong model of computation.
      In general, there are problems that are trivial in the online-LOCAL model, but
      difficult to solve with online graph algorithms and LOCAL algorithms. In this
      thesis, I restrict my attention to the class of problems known as locally checkable
      labeling problems. These are a broad class of problems for which a solution
      is valid if it looks valid in all local neighborhoods. In particular, I show
      that for locally checkable labeling problems in rooted regular trees, the online-LOCAL
      model is approximately as powerful as the LOCAL model.", "venue": "", "year":

      "abstract": "In graph theory we are often interested in a given property (such
      as being distance-regular or vertex-transitive) and we want to classify all
      members of a certain class of graphs that have this property. Usually, the class
      of graphs under consideration is infinite, and so one cannot simply use a computer
      to run through all the examples and test for the given property. Instead, one
      usually first studies \u201csmall\u201d examples in the class, makes conjectures
      and then tries to prove them. One of the first problems that can occur while
      trying to follow this strategy is that the number of \u201csmall\u201d members
      of the class that a computer can handle brute force is too small to allow for
      good conjectures. In such cases one tries to obtain theoretical results that
      either considerably reduce the search space within the class of studied graphs
      or makes the search over members of the class considerably faster. The next
      problem we often encounter is that one either finds no \u201csmall\u201d examples
      and then conjectures that there are no other examples in the studied class,
      or finds that (at least for small orders) all examples seem to be of a \u201ccertain
      kind\u201d. How do we then prove that this is indeed the case? In this talk
      we will consider at least two examples of such situations. In the first one
      we will see that brute force search is so hopeless that there is no way one
      can make any reasonable conjectures. We will then show a nice theoretical argument
      that drastically reduces the search space in a very efficient way. In the second
      example we will see that a brute force computer search seems to indicate that
      there are no examples with the studied property within the given class of graphs.
      We will then indicate how to combine the forces of a computer search and known
      theoretical results to show that this is indeed the case.", "venue": "Conference

      (among other things) determining the cage order \ud835\udc5b ( \ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc54
      ) , which is a notoriously hard problem. This paper provides an algorithmic
      approach for producing ( \ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc54 ) -graphs of larger orders
      from smaller ( \ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc54 ) -graphs in a manner allowing for
      repeated applications. We use this approach to determine/estimate the smallest
      member \ud835\udc41 ( \ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc54 ) of a ( \ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc54
      ) -spectrum having the property that starting from \ud835\udc41 ( \ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc54
      ) all (even; in case of odd \ud835\udc58 ) \ud835\udc5b \u2265 \ud835\udc41
      ( \ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc54 ) belong to the ( \ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc54 ) -spectrum;
      i.e., for all (even) \ud835\udc5b \u2265 \ud835\udc41 ( \ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc54
      ) , there exists a ( \ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc54 ) -graph of order \ud835\udc5b

      "The Integer Multicommodity Flow problem has been studied extensively in the
      literature. However, from a parameterised perspective, mostly special cases,
      such as the Disjoint Paths problem, have been considered. Therefore, we investigate
      the parameterised complexity of the general Integer Multicommodity Flow problem.
      We show that the decision version of this problem on directed graphs for a constant
      number of commodities, when the capacities are given in unary, is XNLP-complete
      with pathwidth as parameter and XALP-complete with treewidth as parameter. When
      the capacities are given in binary, the problem is NP-complete even for graphs
      of pathwidth at most 13. We give related results for undirected graphs. These
      results imply that the problem is unlikely to be fixed-parameter tractable by
      these parameters. In contrast, we show that the problem does become fixed-parameter
      tractable when weighted tree partition width (a variant of tree partition width
      for edge weighted graphs) is used as parameter.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year":

      Networks", "abstract": "Mesh, hypercube, HHN, bubbls-sort, star, transposition,
      and macro-star graphs have been proposed as interconnection networks used in
      high-performance parallel computer structures. A hypercube expresses a node
      with n binary numbers, and has an edge between 1-bit other nodes. A hypercube
      is an excellent network from a graph-theoretic point of view, such as node symmetry,
      fault tolerance, recursive scalability, and Hamiltonian cycles. However, compared
      to the increase in the number of nodes, the number of edges increases proportionally,
      so the network cost is not good. The HHN graph was proposed as a network that
      improved the network cost by improving the disadvantages of the hypercube. HHN
      graph uses hypercube as a basic module. The HHN graph is a network that has
      improved network cost by designing it to have a hierarchical structure based
      on a hypercube. HHN graphs have a simple routing algorithm with fewer branches
      and fewer links than hypercubes. Although HHN''s routing algorithm has a simple
      advantage, it has a disadvantage that the path length is long via unnecessary
      nodes. In this study, we propose a new routing algorithm that improves the path
      length of the HHN graph and analyze its efficiency. The improved routing algorithm
      proposed in this study has the result of improving the existing algorithm by
      30% on average. In addition, we analyze the embedding of one interconnection
      network into another is a very important issue in the design and analysis of
      parallel algorithms. Through such embeddings the algorithms originally developed
      for one architecture can be directly mapped to another architecture. This paper

      EXTENSION problem asks if there exists a set S \\supseteq X with at most k vertices
      such that G[S] is p-edge-connected. This is a natural generalization of a well-studied
      problem STEINER TREE (set p=1 and X as the set of all terminals). In this paper,
      we initiate the study of STEINER SUBGRAPH EXTENSION from the perspective of
      parameterized complexity and give a fixed-parameter algorithm parameterized
      by k and p on graphs of bounded degeneracy. In case we remove the assumption
      of the input graph being bounded degenerate, then the STEINER SUBGRAPH EXTENSION
      problem becomes W[1]-hard. Besides being an independent advance on the parameterized
      complexity of network design problems, our result has natural applications.
      In particular, we use our result to obtain singly exponential-time FPT algorithms
      for several vertex deletion problem studied in the literature, where the goal
      is to delete a smallest set of vertices such that (i) the resulting graph belongs
      to a specific hereditary graph class, and (ii) the deleted set of vertices induces
      a p-edge-connected subgraph of the input graph.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year":

      "abstract": "The problem of determining whether a graph $G$ contains another
      graph $H$ as a minor, referred to as the minor containment problem, is a fundamental
      problem in the field of graph algorithms. While it is NP-complete when $G$ and

      This study focuses on the case where both $G$ and $H$ are trees, known as the
      tree minor containment problem. Even in this case, the problem is known to be
      NP-complete. In contrast, polynomial-time algorithms are known for the case
      when both trees are caterpillars or when the maximum degree of $H$ is a constant.
      Our research aims to clarify the boundary of tractability and intractability

      "title": "Triangle-free $2$-matchings", "abstract": "We consider the problem
      of finding a maximum size triangle-free $2$-matching in a graph $G$. A $2$-matching
      is any subset of the edges such that each vertex is incident to at most two
      edges from the subset. We present a fast combinatorial algorithm for the problem.
      Our algorithm and its analysis are dramatically simpler than the very complicated
      result by Hartvigsen from 1984. In the design of this algorithm we use several
      new concepts. It has been proven before that for any triangle-free $2$-matching
      $M$ which is not maximum the graph contains an $M$-augmenting path, whose application
      to $M$ results in a bigger triangle-free $2$-matching. It was not known how
      to efficiently find such a path. A new observation is that the search for an
      augmenting path $P$ can be restricted to so-called {\\em amenable} paths that
      go through any triangle $t$ contained in $P \\cup M$ a limited number of times.
      To find an augmenting path that is amenable and hence whose application does
      not create any triangle we forbid some edges to be followed by certain others.
      This operation can be thought of as using gadgets, in which some pairs of edges
      get disconnected. To be able to disconnect two edges we employ {\\em half-edges}.
      A {\\em half-edge} of edge $e$ is, informally speaking, a half of $e$ containing
      exactly one of its endpoints. This is another novel application of half-edges
      that were already been used for TSP and other matching problems. Additionally,
      gadgets are not fixed during any augmentation phase, but are dynamically changing
      according to the currently discovered state of reachability by amenable paths.",

      Set of Objects problem, we are given an $n$-vertex planar graph $G$ and a family

      is $\\mathsf{NP}$-hard and is equivalent to the problem of finding the maximum
      number of pairwise disjoint polygons in a given family of polygons in the plane.
      As shown by Adamaszek et al. (J. ACM ''19), the problem admits a \\emph{quasi-polynomial

      path problem (min-sum criterion) is a common problem in graph theory and tree
      networks. This problem is open to study because its applications are growing
      and extending in different \ufb01elds, such as providing insight for decision-makers
      when selecting the optimal location for non-emergency services, including railroad
      lines, highways, pipelines, and transit routes. Also, the min-sum criterion
      can deal with several networks in different applications. The location problem
      has traditionally been concerned with the optimal location of a single-point
      facility at either a vertex or along an edge in a network. Recently, numerous
      investigators have investigated this classic problem and have studied the location
      of many facilities, such as paths, trees, and cycles. The concept of the median,
      which measures the centrality of a vertex in a graph, is extended to the paths
      in a graph. In this paper, we consider the problem of locating path-shaped facilities
      on a tree network. A new modi\ufb01ed and improved algorithm for \ufb01nding
      a median single path facility of a speci\ufb01ed length in a tree network is
      proposed. The median criterion for optimality considers the sum of the distances
      from all vertices of the tree to the path facility. This problem under the median
      criterion is called the (cid:96) -core problem. The distance between any two
      vertices in the tree is equal to the length of the unique path connecting them.

      includes $s$-$t$ Hamiltonian Path as a special case, and hence it is NP-hard.
      In this paper, we first observe that Non-Terminal Spanning Tree, the unweighted
      counterpart of Minimum Weight Non-Terminal Spanning Tree, is already NP-hard
      on some special graph classes. Moreover, it is W[1]-hard when parameterized
      by clique-width. In contrast, we give a $3k$-vertex kernel and $O^*(2^k)$-time

      and their line graphs. But this list is far from complete. The simplest example
      of a ''''non-basic'''' obstruction is due to Pohoata and Davies (independently).
      For every $n \\geq 1$, they construct certain graphs of treewidth $n$ and with
      no $3$-basic obstruction as an induced subgraph, which we call $n$-arrays. Let
      us say a graph class $\\mathcal{G}$ is clean if the only obstructions to bounded

      Linear MIM-width is a variant of the graph parameter MIM-width, introduced by

      "title": "Simpler and Higher Lower Bounds for Shortcut Sets", "abstract": "We
      provide a variety of lower bounds for the well-known shortcut set problem: how
      much can one decrease the diameter of a directed graph on $n$ vertices and $m$
      edges by adding $O(n)$ or $O(m)$ of shortcuts from the transitive closure of
      the graph. Our results are based on a vast simplification of the recent construction
      of Bodwin and Hoppenworth [FOCS 2023] which was used to show an $\\widetilde{\\Omega}(n^{1/4})$
      lower bound for the $O(n)$-sized shortcut set problem. We highlight that our
      simplification completely removes the use of the convex sets by B\\''ar\\''any
      and Larman [Math. Ann. 1998] used in all previous lower bound constructions.
      Our simplification also removes the need for randomness and further removes
      some log factors. This allows us to generalize the construction to higher dimensions,
      which in turn can be used to show the following results. For $O(m)$-sized shortcut
      sets, we show an $\\Omega(n^{1/5})$ lower bound, improving on the previous best
      $\\Omega(n^{1/8})$ lower bound. For all $\\varepsilon>0$, we show that there
      exists a $\\delta>0$ such that there are $n$-vertex $O(n)$-edge graphs $G$ where
      adding any shortcut set of size $O(n^{2-\\varepsilon})$ keeps the diameter of
      $G$ at $\\Omega(n^\\delta)$. This improves the sparsity of the constructed graph
      compared to a known similar result by Hesse [SODA 2003]. We also consider the
      sourcewise setting for shortcut sets: given a graph $G=(V,E)$, a set $S\\subseteq
      V$, how much can we decrease the sourcewise diameter of $G$, $\\max_{(s, v)
      \\in S \\times V, \\text{dist}(s, v)<\\infty} \\text{dist}(s,v)$ by adding a
      set of edges $H$ from the transitive closure of $G$? We show that for any integer
      $d \\ge 2$, there exists a graph $G=(V, E)$ on $n$ vertices and $S \\subseteq
      V$ with $|S| = \\widetilde{\\Theta}(n^{3/(d+3)})$, such that when adding $O(n)$
      or $O(m)$ shortcuts, the sourcewise diameter is $\\widetilde{\\Omega}(|S|^{1/3})$.",

      "The hyperbolicity of a graph, informally, measures how close a graph is (metrically)
      to a tree. Hence, it is intuitively similar to treewidth, but the measures are
      formally incomparable. Motivated by the broad study of algorithms and separators
      on planar graphs and their relation to treewidth, we initiate the study of planar
      graphs of bounded hyperbolicity. Our main technical contribution is a novel
      balanced separator theorem for planar $\\delta$-hyperbolic graphs that is substantially
      stronger than the classic planar separator theorem. For any fixed $\\delta \\geq
      0$, we can find balanced separator that induces either a single geodesic (shortest)
      path or a single geodesic cycle in the graph. An important advantage of our
      separator is that the union of our separator (vertex set $Z$) with any subset
      of the connected components of $G - Z$ induces again a planar $\\delta$-hyperbolic
      graph, which would not be guaranteed with an arbitrary separator. Our construction
      runs in near-linear time and guarantees that size of separator is $\\mathrm{poly}(\\delta)
      \\cdot \\log n$. As an application of our separator theorem and its strong properties,
      we obtain two novel approximation schemes on planar $\\delta$-hyperbolic graphs.
      We prove that Maximum Independent Set and the Traveling Salesperson problem
      have a near-linear time FPTAS for any constant $\\delta$, running in $n\\, \\mathrm{polylog}(n)
      \\cdot 2^{\\mathcal{O}(\\delta^2)} \\cdot \\varepsilon^{-\\mathcal{O}(\\delta)}$
      time. We also show that our approximation scheme for Maximum Independent Set
      has essentially the best possible running time under the Exponential Time Hypothesis
      (ETH). This immediately follows from our third contribution: we prove that Maximum
      Independent Set has no $n^{o(\\delta)}$-time algorithm on planar $\\delta$-hyperbolic

      "title": "Drawn Tree Decomposition: New Approach for Graph Drawing Problems",
      "abstract": "Over the past decade, we witness an increasing amount of interest
      in the design of exact exponential-time and parameterized algorithms for problems
      in Graph Drawing. Unfortunately, we still lack knowledge of general methods
      to develop such algorithms. An even more serious issue is that, here,\"standard\"parameters
      very often yield intractability. In particular, for the most common structural
      parameter, namely, treewidth, we frequently observe NP-hardness already when
      the input graphs are restricted to have constant (often, being just $1$ or $2$)
      treewidth. Our work deals with both drawbacks simultaneously. We introduce a
      novel form of tree decomposition that, roughly speaking, does not decompose
      (only) a graph, but an entire drawing. As such, its bags and separators are
      of geometric (rather than only combinatorial) nature. While the corresponding
      parameter -- like treewidth -- can be arbitrarily smaller than the height (and
      width) of the drawing, we show that -- unlike treewidth -- it gives rise to
      efficient algorithms. Specifically, we get slice-wise polynomial (XP) time algorithms
      parameterized by our parameter. We present a general scheme for the design of
      such algorithms, and apply it to several central problems in Graph Drawing,
      including the recognition of grid graphs, minimization of crossings and bends,
      and compaction. Other than for the class of problems we discussed in the paper,
      we believe that our decomposition and scheme are of independent interest and
      can be further extended or generalized to suit even a wider class of problems.
      Additionally, we discuss classes of drawings where our parameter is bounded
      by $O(\\sqrt{n})$ (where $n$ is the number of vertices of the graph), yielding
      subexponential-time algorithms. Lastly, we prove which relations exist between
      drawn treewidth and other width measures, including treewidth, pathwidth, (dual)
      carving-width and embedded-width.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

      "title": "Flowtigs: safety in flow decompositions for assembly graphs", "abstract":
      "A decomposition of a network flow is a set of weighted paths whose superposition
      equals the flow. The problem of characterising and computing safe walks for
      flow decompositions has so far seen only a partial solution by restricting the
      flow decomposition to consist of paths, and the graph to be directed and acyclic
      (DAG). However, the problem of decomposing into closed walks in a general graph
      (allowing cycles) is still open. In this paper, we give a simple and linear-time-verifiable
      complete characterisation (flowtigs) of walks that are safe in such general
      flow decompositions, i.e. that are subwalks of any possible flow decomposition.
      Our characterisation generalises over the previous one for DAGs, using a more
      involved proof of correctness that works around various issues introduced by
      cycles. We additionally provide an optimal O(mn)-time algorithm that identifies
      all maximal flowtigs and represents them inside a compact structure. We also
      implement this algorithm and show that it is very fast in practice. On the practical
      side, we study flowtigs in the use-case of metagenomic assembly. By using the
      abundances of the metagenomic assembly graph as flow values, we can model the
      possible assembly solutions as flow decompositions into closed walks. Compared
      to reporting unitigs or maximal safe walks based only on the graph structure
      (structural contigs), reporting flowtigs results in a notably more contiguous
      assembly. Specifically, on shorter contigs (75-percentile), we get an improvement
      in assembly contiguity of up to 100% over unitigs, and up to 61.9% over structural
      contigs. For the 50-percentile of contiguity we get an improvement of up to
      17.0% over unitigs and up to 14.6% over structural contigs. These improvements
      are more pronounced the more complex the assembly graphs are, and the improvements
      of flowtigs over unitigs are multiple times larger compared to the improvements

      "title": "Computing Twin-Width Parameterized by the Feedback Edge Number", "abstract":
      "The problem of whether and how one can compute the twin-width of a graph --
      along with an accompanying contraction sequence -- lies at the forefront of
      the area of algorithmic model theory. While significant effort has been aimed
      at obtaining a fixed-parameter approximation for the problem when parameterized
      by twin-width, here we approach the question from a different perspective and
      consider whether one can obtain (near-)optimal contraction sequences under a
      larger parameterization, notably the feedback edge number $k$. As our main contributions,
      under this parameterization we obtain (1) a linear bikernel for the problem
      of either computing a $2$-contraction sequence or determining that none exists
      and (2) an approximate fixed-parameter algorithm which computes an $\\ell$-contraction
      sequence (for an arbitrary specified $\\ell$) or determines that the twin-width
      of the input graph is at least $\\ell$. These algorithmic results rely on newly
      obtained insights into the structure of optimal contraction sequences, and as
      a byproduct of these we also slightly tighten the bound on the twin-width of
      graphs with small feedback edge number.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023,

      "title": "The \u03bb-Fold Spectrum Problem for the Orientations of the Eight-Cycle",
      "abstract": "A D-decomposition of a graph (or digraph) G is a partition of the
      edge set (or arc set) of G into subsets, where each subset induces a copy of
      the fixed graph D. Graph decomposition finds motivation in numerous practical
      applications, particularly in the realm of symmetric graphs, where these decompositions
      illuminate intricate symmetrical patterns within the graph, aiding in various
      fields such as network design, and combinatorial mathematics, among various
      others. Of particular interest is the case where G is K*\u03bbKv*, the \u03bb-fold
      complete symmetric digraph on v vertices, that is, the digraph with \u03bb directed
      edges in each direction between each pair of vertices. For a given digraph D,
      the set of all values v for which K*\u03bbKv* has a D-decomposition is called
      the \u03bb-fold spectrum of D. An eight-cycle has 22 non-isomorphic orientations.
      The \u03bb-fold spectrum problem has been solved for one of these oriented cycles.
      In this paper, we provide a complete solution to the \u03bb-fold spectrum problem
      for each of the remaining 21 orientations.", "venue": "Symmetry", "year": 2023,
