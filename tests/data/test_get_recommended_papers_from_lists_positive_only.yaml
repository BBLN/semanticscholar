      "title": "One-wasy trail orientation", "abstract": "Given a graph, does there
      exist an orientation of the edges such that the resulting directed graph is
      strongly connected? Robbins\u2019 theorem [Robbins, Am. Math. Monthly, 1939]
      asserts that such an orientation exists if and only if the graph is 2-edge connected.
      A natural extension of this problem is the following: Suppose that the edges
      of the graph are partitioned into trails. Can the trails be oriented consistently
      such that the resulting directed graph is strongly connected? We show that 2-edge
      connectivity is again a su\ufb03cient condition and we provide a linear time
      algorithm for \ufb01nding such an orientation. The generalised Robbins\u2019
      theorem [Boesch, Am. Math. Monthly, 1980] for mixed multigraphs asserts that
      the undirected edges of a mixed multigraph can be oriented to make the resulting
      directed graph strongly connected exactly when the mixed graph is strongly connected
      and the underlying graph is bridgeless. We consider the natural extension where
      the undirected edges of a mixed multigraph are partitioned into trails. It turns
      out that in this case the condition of the generalised Robbin\u2019s Theorem
      is not su\ufb03cient. However, we show that as long as each cut either contains
      at least 2 undirected edges or directed edges in both directions, there exists
      an orientation of the trails such that the resulting directed graph is strongly
      connected. Moreover, if the condition is satis\ufb01ed, we may start by orienting

      "title": "Separator Theorem and Algorithms for Planar Hyperbolic Graphs", "abstract":
      "The hyperbolicity of a graph, informally, measures how close a graph is (metrically)
      to a tree. Hence, it is intuitively similar to treewidth, but the measures are
      formally incomparable. Motivated by the broad study of algorithms and separators
      on planar graphs and their relation to treewidth, we initiate the study of planar
      graphs of bounded hyperbolicity. Our main technical contribution is a novel
      balanced separator theorem for planar $\\delta$-hyperbolic graphs that is substantially
      stronger than the classic planar separator theorem. For any fixed $\\delta \\geq
      0$, we can find balanced separator that induces either a single geodesic (shortest)
      path or a single geodesic cycle in the graph. An important advantage of our
      separator is that the union of our separator (vertex set $Z$) with any subset
      of the connected components of $G - Z$ induces again a planar $\\delta$-hyperbolic
      graph, which would not be guaranteed with an arbitrary separator. Our construction
      runs in near-linear time and guarantees that size of separator is $\\mathrm{poly}(\\delta)
      \\cdot \\log n$. As an application of our separator theorem and its strong properties,
      we obtain two novel approximation schemes on planar $\\delta$-hyperbolic graphs.
      We prove that Maximum Independent Set and the Traveling Salesperson problem
      have a near-linear time FPTAS for any constant $\\delta$, running in $n\\, \\mathrm{polylog}(n)
      \\cdot 2^{\\mathcal{O}(\\delta^2)} \\cdot \\varepsilon^{-\\mathcal{O}(\\delta)}$
      time. We also show that our approximation scheme for Maximum Independent Set
      has essentially the best possible running time under the Exponential Time Hypothesis
      (ETH). This immediately follows from our third contribution: we prove that Maximum
      Independent Set has no $n^{o(\\delta)}$-time algorithm on planar $\\delta$-hyperbolic
      graphs, unless ETH fails.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

      "title": "On the Size Overhead of Pairwise Spanners", "abstract": "Given an
      undirected possibly weighted $n$-vertex graph $G=(V,E)$ and a set $\\mathcal{P}\\subseteq
      V^2$ of pairs, a subgraph $S=(V,E'')$ is called a ${\\cal P}$-pairwise $\\alpha$-spanner
      of $G$, if for every pair $(u,v)\\in\\mathcal{P}$ we have $d_S(u,v)\\leq\\alpha\\cdot
      d_G(u,v)$. The parameter $\\alpha$ is called the stretch of the spanner, and
      its size overhead is define as $\\frac{|E''|}{|{\\cal P}|}$. A surprising connection
      was recently discussed between the additive stretch of $(1+\\epsilon,\\beta)$-spanners,
      to the hopbound of $(1+\\epsilon,\\beta)$-hopsets. A long sequence of works
      showed that if the spanner/hopset has size $\\approx n^{1+1/k}$ for some parameter
      $k\\ge 1$, then $\\beta\\approx\\left(\\frac1\\epsilon\\right)^{\\log k}$. In
      this paper we establish a new connection to the size overhead of pairwise spanners.
      In particular, we show that if $|{\\cal P}|\\approx n^{1+1/k}$, then a ${\\cal
      P}$-pairwise $(1+\\epsilon)$-spanner must have size at least $\\beta\\cdot |{\\cal
      P}|$ with $\\beta\\approx\\left(\\frac1\\epsilon\\right)^{\\log k}$ (a near
      matching upper bound was recently shown in \\cite{ES23}). We also extend the
      connection between pairwise spanners and hopsets to the large stretch regime,
      by showing nearly matching upper and lower bounds for ${\\cal P}$-pairwise $\\alpha$-spanners.
      In particular, we show that if $|{\\cal P}|\\approx n^{1+1/k}$, then the size
      overhead is $\\beta\\approx\\frac k\\alpha$. A source-wise spanner is a special
      type of pairwise spanner, for which ${\\cal P}=A\\times V$ for some $A\\subseteq
      V$. A prioritized spanner is given also a ranking of the vertices $V=(v_1,\\dots,v_n)$,
      and is required to provide improved stretch for pairs containing higher ranked
      vertices. By using a sequence of reductions, we improve on the state-of-the-art

      path problem (min-sum criterion) is a common problem in graph theory and tree
      networks. This problem is open to study because its applications are growing
      and extending in different \ufb01elds, such as providing insight for decision-makers
      when selecting the optimal location for non-emergency services, including railroad
      lines, highways, pipelines, and transit routes. Also, the min-sum criterion
      can deal with several networks in different applications. The location problem
      has traditionally been concerned with the optimal location of a single-point
      facility at either a vertex or along an edge in a network. Recently, numerous
      investigators have investigated this classic problem and have studied the location
      of many facilities, such as paths, trees, and cycles. The concept of the median,
      which measures the centrality of a vertex in a graph, is extended to the paths
      in a graph. In this paper, we consider the problem of locating path-shaped facilities
      on a tree network. A new modi\ufb01ed and improved algorithm for \ufb01nding
      a median single path facility of a speci\ufb01ed length in a tree network is
      proposed. The median criterion for optimality considers the sum of the distances
      from all vertices of the tree to the path facility. This problem under the median
      criterion is called the (cid:96) -core problem. The distance between any two
      vertices in the tree is equal to the length of the unique path connecting them.
      This location problem usually has applications in distributed database systems,
      pipelines, the design of public transportation routes, and communication networks.",

      "title": "Triangle-free $2$-matchings", "abstract": "We consider the problem
      of finding a maximum size triangle-free $2$-matching in a graph $G$. A $2$-matching
      is any subset of the edges such that each vertex is incident to at most two
      edges from the subset. We present a fast combinatorial algorithm for the problem.
      Our algorithm and its analysis are dramatically simpler than the very complicated
      result by Hartvigsen from 1984. In the design of this algorithm we use several
      new concepts. It has been proven before that for any triangle-free $2$-matching
      $M$ which is not maximum the graph contains an $M$-augmenting path, whose application
      to $M$ results in a bigger triangle-free $2$-matching. It was not known how
      to efficiently find such a path. A new observation is that the search for an
      augmenting path $P$ can be restricted to so-called {\\em amenable} paths that
      go through any triangle $t$ contained in $P \\cup M$ a limited number of times.
      To find an augmenting path that is amenable and hence whose application does
      not create any triangle we forbid some edges to be followed by certain others.
      This operation can be thought of as using gadgets, in which some pairs of edges
      get disconnected. To be able to disconnect two edges we employ {\\em half-edges}.
      A {\\em half-edge} of edge $e$ is, informally speaking, a half of $e$ containing
      exactly one of its endpoints. This is another novel application of half-edges
      that were already been used for TSP and other matching problems. Additionally,
      gadgets are not fixed during any augmentation phase, but are dynamically changing
      according to the currently discovered state of reachability by amenable paths.",

      Given a Hamiltonian graph G , and a Hamiltonian cycle C of G , can we compute
      a second Hamiltonian cycle C \u2032 \u0338 = C of G , and if yes, how quickly?
      If the input graph G satisfies certain conditions (e.g. if every vertex of G
      is odd, or if the minimum degree is large enough), it is known that such a second
      Hamiltonian cycle always exists. Despite substantial efforts, no subexponential-time
      algorithm is known for this problem. In this paper we relax the problem of computing
      a second Hamiltonian cycle in two ways. First, we consider approximating the
      length of a second cycle on n -vertex graphs with minimum degree \u03b4 and
      maximum degree \u2206. We provide a linear-time algorithm for computing a cycle
      C \u2032 \u0338 = C of length at least n \u2212 4 \u03b1 ( \u221a n + 2 \u03b1
      ) + 8, where \u03b1 = \u2206 \u2212 2 \u03b4 \u2212 2 . Our second relaxation
      of the problem is probabilistic. We propose a randomized algorithm which computes
      a second Hamiltonian cycle with high probability , given that the input graph
      G has a large enough minimum degree. More specifically, we prove that for every
      0 < p \u2264 0 . 02, if the minimum degree of G is at least 8 p log 2 \u221a
      8 n + 4, then a second Hamiltonian cycle can be computed with probability at

      at most $k$ such that in graph $G-S$, no pair of distinct terminals can be connected
      by two pairwise internally vertex-disjoint paths. Hence each terminal pair can
      be separated in $G-S$ by removing at most one vertex. The problem is therefore
      a generalization of (Node) Multiway Cut, which asks for a vertex set for which
      each terminal is in a different component of $G-S$. We develop a fixed-parameter

      with respect to important separators, along with two problem-specific ingredients.
      The first is a polynomial-time subroutine to reduce the number of terminals

      is the problem of finding a minimal set of edge modifications to transform a
      given graph into a cluster graph - a graph whose connected components are cliques.
      A set of induced, vertex pair disjoint paths of length two in the given graph
      is a lower bound for the number of required edge modifications. To find such
      sets, we define and examine a type of intersection graph, the P 3 - intersection
      graph , that models which induced paths of length two, called P 3 s, in a given
      graph share a vertex pair. Now, any independent set on the P 3 -intersection
      graph yields a lower bound for the Cluster Editing problem on the given graph.
      Unfortunately, Maximum Independent Set generally is NP-hard. However, the complexity
      on P 3 -intersection graphs is unknown. In this work, we show that the neighbourhood
      of every vertex in a P 3 -intersection graph can be partitioned into three cliques
      characterized by which vertex pair the contained vertices share with the respective
      vertex. We also prove that edges between these cliques strictly follow a specific

      "title": "Recognizing trees from incomplete decks", "abstract": "For a given
      graph, the unlabeled subgraphs $G-v$ are called the cards of $G$ and the deck
      of $G$ is the multiset $\\{G-v: v \\in V(G)\\}$. Wendy Myrvold [Ars Combinatoria,
      1989] showed that a non-connected graph and a connected graph both on $n$ vertices
      have at most $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor +1$ cards in common and she found
      (infinite) families of trees and non-connected forests for which this upper
      bound is tight. Bowler, Brown, and Fenner [Journal of Graph Theory, 2010] conjectured
      that this bound is tight for $n \\geq 44$. In this article, we prove this conjecture
      for sufficiently large $n$. The main result is that a tree $T$ and a unicyclic
      graph $G$ on $n$ vertices have at most $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor+1$ common
      cards. Combined with Myrvold''s work this shows that it can be determined whether
      a graph on $n$ vertices is a tree from any $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2}\\rfloor+1$
      of its cards. Based on this theorem, it follows that any forest and non-forest
      also have at most $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor +1$ common cards. Moreover,
      we have classified all except finitely many pairs for which this bound is strict.
      Furthermore, the main ideas of the proof for trees are used to show that the
      girth of a graph on $n$ vertices can be determined based on any $\\frac{2n}{3}
      +1$ of its cards. Lastly, we show that any $\\frac{5n}{6} +2$ cards determine

      and Packing Problems", "abstract": "Let U be a universe on n elements, let k
      be a positive integer, and let F be a family of (implicitly defined) subsets
      of U. We consider the problems of partitioning U into k sets from F, covering
      U with k sets from F, and packing k non-intersecting sets from F into U. Classically,
      these problems can be solved via inclusion-exclusion in O*(2^n) time [BjorklundHK09].
      Quantumly, there are faster algorithms for graph coloring with running time
      O(1.9140^n) [ShimizuM22] and for Set Cover with a small number of sets with
      running time O(1.7274^n |F|^O(1)) [AmbainisBIKPV19]. In this paper, we give
      a quantum speedup for Set Partition, Set Cover, and Set Packing whenever there
      is a classical enumeration algorithm that lends itself to a quadratic quantum
      speedup, which, for any subinstance on a subset X of U, enumerates at least
      one member of a k-partition, k-cover, or k-packing (if one exists) restricted
      to (or projected onto, in the case of k-cover) the set X in O*(c^{|X|}) time
      with c<2. Our bounded-error quantum algorithm runs in O*((2+c)^(n/2)) for Set
      Partition, Set Cover, and Set Packing. When c<=1.147899, our algorithm is slightly
      faster than O*((2+c)^(n/2)); when c approaches 1, it matches the running time
      of [AmbainisBIKPV19] for Set Cover when |F| is subexponential in n. For Graph
      Coloring, we further improve the running time to O(1.7956^n) by leveraging faster
      algorithms for coloring with a small number of colors to better balance our
      divide-and-conquer steps. For Domatic Number, we obtain a O((2-\\epsilon)^n)

      we provide simpler reductions from Exact Triangle to two important problems
      in fine-grained complexity: Exact Triangle with Few Zero-Weight $4$-Cycles and
      All-Edges Sparse Triangle. Exact Triangle instances with few zero-weight $4$-cycles
      was considered by Jin and Xu [STOC 2023], who used it as an intermediate problem
      to show $3$SUM hardness of All-Edges Sparse Triangle with few $4$-cycles (independently
      obtained by Abboud, Bringmann and Fischer [STOC 2023]), which is further used
      to show $3$SUM hardness of a variety of problems, including $4$-Cycle Enumeration,
      Offline Approximate Distance Oracle, Dynamic Approximate Shortest Paths and
      All-Nodes Shortest Cycles. We provide a simple reduction from Exact Triangle
      to Exact Triangle with few zero-weight $4$-cycles. Our new reduction not only
      simplifies Jin and Xu''s previous reduction, but also strengthens the conditional
      lower bounds from being under the $3$SUM hypothesis to the even more believable
      Exact Triangle hypothesis. As a result, all conditional lower bounds shown by

      Set of Objects problem, we are given an $n$-vertex planar graph $G$ and a family
      $\\mathcal{D}$ of $N$ objects, where each object is a connected subgraph of

      of maximum cardinality that consists of pairwise disjoint objects. This problem
      is $\\mathsf{NP}$-hard and is equivalent to the problem of finding the maximum
      number of pairwise disjoint polygons in a given family of polygons in the plane.
      As shown by Adamaszek et al. (J. ACM ''19), the problem admits a \\emph{quasi-polynomial
      time approximation scheme} (QPTAS): a $(1-\\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm
      whose running time is bounded by $2^{\\mathrm{poly}(\\log(N),1/\\epsilon)} \\cdot

      regime only the trivial $\\mathcal{O}(N)$-approximation is known for the problem
      in full generality. In the restricted setting where the objects are pseudolines
      in the plane, Fox and Pach (SODA ''11) gave an $N^{\\varepsilon}$-approximation
      algorithm with running time $N^{2^{\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(1/\\varepsilon)}}$,

      n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}$, for any $\\varepsilon>0$, thus improving upon the result

      model is defined as the union of any $n$-vertex graph $G_0$ with minimum degree
      $\\delta n$ and the binomial random graph $\\mathbf{G}(n,p)$ on the same vertex
      set. Moreover, we say that a graph is uniformly coloured with colours in $\\mathcal{C}$
      if each edge is coloured independently and uniformly at random with a colour
      from $\\mathcal{C}$. Based on a coupling idea of McDiarmird, we provide a general
      tool to tackle problems concerning finding a rainbow copy of a graph $H=H(n)$
      in a uniformly coloured perturbed $n$-vertex graph with colours in $[(1+o(1))e(H)]$.
      For example, our machinery easily allows to recover a result of Aigner-Horev
      and Hefetz concerning rainbow Hamilton cycles, and to improve a result of Aigner-Horev,
      Hefetz and Lahiri concerning rainbow bounded-degree spanning trees. Furthermore,
      using different methods, we prove that for any $\\delta \\in (0,1)$ and integer
      $d \\ge 2$, there exists $C=C(\\delta,d)>0$ such that the following holds. Let
      $T$ be a tree on $n$ vertices with maximum degree at most $d$ and $G_0$ be an
      $n$-vertex graph with $\\delta(G_0)\\ge \\delta n$. Then a uniformly coloured
      $G_0 \\cup \\mathbf{G}(n,C/n)$ with colours in $[n-1]$ contains a rainbow copy
      of $T$ with high probability. This is optimal both in terms of colours and edge
      probability (up to a constant factor).", "venue": "", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

      dominating set is a graph problem that asks for the smallest subset of vertices

      The second rule allows for propagation of the observation status to vertices

      "In this paper, we study the problem of finding a minimum weight spanning tree
      that contains each vertex in a given subset $V_{\\rm NT}$ of vertices as an
      internal vertex. This problem, called Minimum Weight Non-Terminal Spanning Tree,
      includes $s$-$t$ Hamiltonian Path as a special case, and hence it is NP-hard.
      In this paper, we first observe that Non-Terminal Spanning Tree, the unweighted
      counterpart of Minimum Weight Non-Terminal Spanning Tree, is already NP-hard
      on some special graph classes. Moreover, it is W[1]-hard when parameterized
      by clique-width. In contrast, we give a $3k$-vertex kernel and $O^*(2^k)$-time
      algorithm, where $k$ is the size of non-terminal set $V_{\\rm NT}$. The latter
      algorithm can be extended to Minimum Weight Non-Terminal Spanning Tree with
      the restriction that each edge has a polynomially bounded integral weight. We
      also show that Minimum Weight Non-Terminal Spanning Tree is fixed-parameter
      tractable parameterized by the number of edges in the subgraph induced by the
      non-terminal set $V_{\\rm NT}$, extending the fixed-parameter tractability of

      Minimum Clique Routing Problem on Cycles \\textsc{MCRPC} we are given a cycle
      together with a set of demands (weighted origin-destination pairs) and the goal
      is to route all the pairs minimizing the maximum weighted clique of the intersection
      graph induced by the routing. The vertices of this graph are the demands with
      their corresponding weights and two demands are adjacent when their routes share
      at least one arc. In this work we are not only interested in the \\textsc{MCRPC}
      but also in two natural subproblems. First, we consider the situation where
      the demands are disjoint, in the sense that every two demands do not share any
      of their corresponding ends. Second, we analyze the subproblem where the weights
      of the routes are all equal. We first show that the problem is NP-complete even
      in the subproblem of disjoint demands. For the case of arbitrary weights, we
      exhibit a simple combinatorial 2-approximation algorithm and a $\\frac{3}{2}$-approximation
      algorithm based on rounding a solution of a relaxation of an integer linear
      programming formulation of our problem. Finally, we give a Fixed Parameter Tractable
      algorithm for the case of uniform weights, whose parameter is related to the
      maximum degree of the intersection graph induced by any routing.", "venue":

      "title": "An Enumerative Perspective on Connectivity", "abstract": "Connectivity
      (or equivalently, unweighted maximum flow) is an important measure in graph
      theory and combinatorial optimization. Given a graph $G$ with vertices $s$ and
      $t$, the connectivity $\\lambda(s,t)$ from $s$ to $t$ is defined to be the maximum
      number of edge-disjoint paths from $s$ to $t$ in $G$. Much research has gone
      into designing fast algorithms for computing connectivities in graphs. Previous
      work showed that it is possible to compute connectivities for all pairs of vertices
      in directed graphs with $m$ edges in $\\tilde{O}(m^\\omega)$ time [Chueng, Lau,
      and Leung, FOCS 2011], where $\\omega \\in [2,2.3716)$ is the exponent of matrix
      multiplication. For the related problem of computing\"small connectivities,\"it
      was recently shown that for any positive integer $k$, we can compute $\\min(k,\\lambda(s,t))$
      for all pairs of vertices $(s,t)$ in a directed graph with $n$ nodes in $\\tilde{O}((kn)^\\omega)$
      time [Akmal and Jin, ICALP 2023]. In this paper, we present an alternate exposition
      of these $\\tilde{O}(m^\\omega)$ and $\\tilde{O}((kn)^\\omega)$ time algorithms,
      with simpler proofs of correctness. Earlier proofs were somewhat indirect, introducing
      an elegant but ad hoc\"flow vector framework\"for showing correctness of these
      algorithms. In contrast, we observe that these algorithms for computing exact
      and small connectivity values can be interpreted as testing whether certain
      generating functions enumerating families of edge-disjoint paths are nonzero.
      This new perspective yields more transparent proofs, and ties the approach for
      these problems more closely to the literature surrounding algebraic graph algorithms.",

      Mincuts", "abstract": "A cactus representation of a graph, introduced by Dinitz
      et al. in 1976, is an edge sparsifier of $O(n)$ size that exactly captures all
      global minimum cuts of the graph. It is a central combinatorial object that
      has been a key ingredient in almost all algorithms for the connectivity augmentation
      problems and for maintaining minimum cuts under edge insertions (e.g. [NGM97],
      [CKL+22], [Hen97]). This sparsifier was generalized to Steiner cactus for a
      vertex set $T$, which can be seen as a vertex sparsifier of $O(|T|)$ size that
      captures all partitions of $T$ corresponding to a $T$-Steiner minimum cut, and
      also hypercactus, an analogous concept in hypergraphs. These generalizations
      further extend the applications of cactus to the Steiner and hypergraph settings.
      In a long line of work on fast constructions of cactus and its generalizations,
      a near-linear time construction of cactus was shown by [Karger and Panigrahi
      2009]. Unfortunately, their technique based on tree packing inherently does
      not generalize. The state-of-the-art algorithms for Steiner cactus and hypercactus
      are still slower than linear time by a factor of $\\Omega(|T|)$ [DV94] and $\\Omega(n)$
      [CX17], respectively. We show how to construct both Steiner cactus and hypercactus
      using polylogarithmic calls to max flow, which gives the first almost-linear
      time algorithms of both problems. The constructions immediately imply almost-linear-time
      connectivity augmentation algorithms in the Steiner and hypergraph settings,
      as well as speed up the incremental algorithm for maintaining minimum cuts in
      hypergraphs by a factor of $n$. The key technique behind our result is a novel
      variant of the influential isolating mincut technique [LP20, AKL+21] which we

      measure the amount of structure (or lack thereof) in a graph that makes it amenable
      to being decomposed in a way that facilitates dynamic programming. Graph decompositions
      and their associated parameters are important both in practice (as a tool for
      designing robust algorithms for NP-hard problems) and in theory (relating large
      classes of problems to the graphs on which they are solvable in polynomial time).
      Linear MIM-width is a variant of the graph parameter MIM-width, introduced by
      Vatshelle. MIM-width is a parameter that is constant for many classes of graphs.
      Most graph classes which have been shown to have constant MIM-width also have
      constant linear MIM-width. However, computing the (linear) MIM-width of graphs,
      or showing that it is hard, has proven to be a huge challenge. To date, the
      only graph class with unbounded linear MIM-width, whose linear MIM-width can
      be computed in polynomial time, is the trees. In this follow-up, we show that
      for any tree $T$ with linear MIM-width $k$, the linear MIM-width of its square
      $T^2$ always lies between $k$ and $2k$, and that these bounds are tight for
      all $k$.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "referenceCount": 25, "citationCount":

      on graphs, called cup stacking, following a line of what can be considered as
      $0$-, $1$-, or $2$-person games such as chip firing, percolation, graph burning,
      zero forcing, cops and robbers, graph pebbling, and graph pegging, among others.
      It can be more general, but the most basic scenario begins with a single cup
      on each vertex of a graph. For a vertex with $k$ cups on it we can move all
      its cups to a vertex at distance $k$ from it, provided the second vertex already
      has at least one cup on it. The object is to stack all cups onto some pre-described
      target vertex. We say that a graph is stackable if this can be accomplished
      for all possible target vertices. In this paper we study cup stacking on many
      families of graphs, developing a characterization of stackability in graphs
      and using it to prove the stackability of complete graphs, paths, cycles, grids,
      the Petersen graph, many Kneser graphs, some trees, cubes of dimension up to
      20,\"somewhat balanced\"complete $t$-partite graphs, and Hamiltonian diameter
      two graphs. Additionally we use the Gallai-Edmonds Structure Theorem, the Edmonds
      Blossom Algorithm, and the Hungarian algorithm to devise a polynomial algorithm
      to decide if a diameter two graph is stackable. Our proof that cubes up to dimension
      20 are stackable uses Kleitman''s Symmetric Chain Decomposition and the new
      result of Merino, M\\\"utze, and Namrata that all generalized Johnson graphs
      (excluding the Petersen graph) are Hamiltonian. We conjecture that all cubes

      a new heuristic algorithm for computing a minimum FAS in directed graphs. The
      new technique produces solutions that, for graph drawing datasets, are better
      than the ones produced by the best previously known heuristics, often reducing
      the FAS size by more than 50%. The heuristic is based on computing the PageRank
      score of the nodes of the directed line graph of the input directed graph. Although
      the time required by our heuristic is heavily influenced by the size of the
      produced line graph, our experimental results show that it runs very fast even
      for very large graphs used in graph drawing. We compare results produced by
      our heuristic to known exact results for specific graphs used in a previous
      study and discuss the interesting trade-off. Finally, our experimental results

      number of commodities, when the capacities are given in unary, is XNLP-complete
      with pathwidth as parameter and XALP-complete with treewidth as parameter. When
      the capacities are given in binary, the problem is NP-complete even for graphs
      of pathwidth at most 13. We give related results for undirected graphs. These
      results imply that the problem is unlikely to be fixed-parameter tractable by
      these parameters. In contrast, we show that the problem does become fixed-parameter
      tractable when weighted tree partition width (a variant of tree partition width

      routing", "abstract": "We consider several basic questions on distributed routing
      in directed graphs with multiple additive costs, or metrics, and multiple constraints.
      Distributed routing in this sense is used in several protocols, such as IS-IS
      and OSPF. A practical approach to the multi-constraint routing problem is to,
      first, combine the metrics into a single `composite'' metric, and then apply
      one-to-all shortest path algorithms, e.g. Dijkstra, in order to find shortest
      path trees. We show that, in general, even if a feasible path exists and is
      known for every source and destination pair, it is impossible to guarantee a
      distributed routing under several constraints. We also study the question of
      choosing the optimal `composite'' metric. We show that under certain mathematical
      assumptions we can efficiently find a convex combination of several metrics
      that maximizes the number of discovered feasible paths. Sometimes it can be
      done analytically, and is in general possible using what we call a ''smart iterative
      approach''. We illustrate these findings by extensive experiments on several
      typical network topologies.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

      "We provide a deterministic algorithm for computing the $5$-edge-connected components
      of an undirected multigraph in linear time. There were probably good indications
      that this computation can be performed in linear time, but no such algorithm
      was actually known prior to this work. Thus, our paper answers a theoretical
      question, and sheds light on the possibility that a solution may exist for general
      $k$. A key component in our algorithm is an oracle for answering connectivity
      queries for pairs of vertices in the presence of at most four edge-failures.
      Specifically, the oracle has size $O(n)$, it can be constructed in linear time,
      and it answers connectivity queries in the presence of at most four edge-failures
      in worst-case constant time, where $n$ denotes the number of vertices of the
      graph. We note that this is a result of independent interest. Our paper can
      be considered as a follow-up of recent work on computing the $4$-edge-connected
      components in linear time. However, in dealing with the computation of the $5$-edge-connected
      components, we are faced with unique challenges that do not appear when dealing
      with lower connectivity. The problem is that the $4$-edge cuts in $3$-edge-connected
      graphs are entangled in various complicated ways, that make it difficult to
      organize them in a compact way. Here we provide a novel analysis of those cuts,
      that reveals the existence of various interesting structures. These can be exploited
      so that we can disentangle and collect only those cuts that are essential in
      computing the $5$-edge-connected components. This analysis may provide a clue
      for a general solution for the $k$-edge-connected components, or other related

      "The problem of whether and how one can compute the twin-width of a graph --
      along with an accompanying contraction sequence -- lies at the forefront of
      the area of algorithmic model theory. While significant effort has been aimed
      at obtaining a fixed-parameter approximation for the problem when parameterized
      by twin-width, here we approach the question from a different perspective and
      consider whether one can obtain (near-)optimal contraction sequences under a
      larger parameterization, notably the feedback edge number $k$. As our main contributions,
      under this parameterization we obtain (1) a linear bikernel for the problem
      of either computing a $2$-contraction sequence or determining that none exists

      (DiGraph) on n vertices and m edges with source s and sink t. An edge in G is
      vital if its removal reduces the capacity of (s,t)-mincut. Since the seminal
      work of Ford and Fulkerson, a long line of work has been done on computing the
      most vital edge and all vital edges of G. Unfortunately, after 60 years, the
      existing results are for undirected or unweighted graphs. We present the following
      result for DiGraph, which solves an open problem stated by Ausiello et al. 1.
      There is an algorithm that computes all vital edges as well as the most vital
      edge of G using O(n) maxflow computations. Vital edges play a crucial role in
      the design of Sensitivity Oracle (SO) for (s,t)-mincut. For directed graphs,
      the only existing SO is for unweighted graphs by Picard and Queyranne. We present
      the first and optimal SO for DiGraph. 2. (a) There is an O(n) space SO that
      can report in O(1) time the capacity of (s,t)-mincut and (b) an O($n^2$) space
      SO that can report an (s,t)-mincut in O(n) time after failure/insertion of an
      edge. For unweighted graphs, Picard and Queyranne designed an O(m) space DAG
      that stores and characterizes all mincuts for all vital edges. Conversely, there
      is a set containing at most n-1 (s,t)-cuts such that at least one mincut for
      every vital edge belongs to the set. We generalize these results for DiGraph.
      3. (a) There is a set containing at most n-1 (s,t)-cuts such that at least one
      mincut for every vital edge is present in the set. (b) We design two compact
      structures for storing and characterizing all mincuts for all vital edges, (i)
      O(m) space DAG for partial characterization and (ii) O(mn) space structure for
      complete characterization. To arrive at our results, we develop new techniques,

      "title": "Locally Checkable Labeling Problems in Rooted Trees in the Online-LOCAL
      Model of Computation", "abstract": "There are many ways to classify algorithms.
      Online algorithms, for example, are algorithms that have to be able to handle
      input one element at a time. Offline algorithms, on the other hand, have access
      to the whole input. In the case of online graph algorithms, the structure of
      the underlying graph is fixed. The graph is revealed to the algorithm one node
      at a time. When a node is revealed, the algorithm has to decide its output for
      that node, and it cannot change its decision later. Another way to classify
      algorithms is to divide them into centralized and distributed algorithms. In
      the case of graph algorithms, a centralized algorithm is a completely separate
      entity from the graph. When the nodes (or edges) of the graph are active parties
      in the execution of the algorithm, the algorithm is called a distributed algorithm.
      One commonly used model of distributed computation is the LOCAL model. In the
      LOCAL model, all nodes are computing their own part of the result in parallel.
      The nodes only see their own local neighborhood and need to base their decision
      only on this local view. In this thesis, I introduce the online-LOCAL model,
      which combines the power of online graph algorithms and LOCAL algorithms. Like
      online graph algorithms, online-LOCAL algorithms need to react to nodes being
      revealed one at a time. Unlike online graph algorithms, online-LOCAL algorithms
      also get to see the local neighborhood around the nodes before needing to make
      their decisions. The online-LOCAL model is a very strong model of computation.
      In general, there are problems that are trivial in the online-LOCAL model, but
      difficult to solve with online graph algorithms and LOCAL algorithms. In this
      thesis, I restrict my attention to the class of problems known as locally checkable
      labeling problems. These are a broad class of problems for which a solution
      is valid if it looks valid in all local neighborhoods. In particular, I show
      that for locally checkable labeling problems in rooted regular trees, the online-LOCAL
      model is approximately as powerful as the LOCAL model.", "venue": "", "year":
