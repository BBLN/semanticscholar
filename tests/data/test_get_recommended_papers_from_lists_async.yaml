      vertices are exactly the chordal graphs which are also C-I graphs. A similar

      "title": "Burning a binary tree and its generalization", "abstract": "Graph
      burning is a graph process that models the spread of social contagion. Initially,
      all the vertices of a graph G are unburnt. At each step, an unburnt vertex is
      put on fire and the fire from burnt vertices of the previous step spreads to
      their adjacent unburnt vertices. This process continues till all vertices are
      burnt. The burning number $b(G)$ of the graph $G$ is the minimum number of steps
      required to burn all the vertices in the graph. The burning number conjecture
      by Bonato et al. states that for a connected graph G of order n, its burning
      number $b(G) \\leq \\lceil \\sqrt{n} \\rceil$. It is easy to observe that in
      order to burn a graph it is enough to burn its spanning tree. Hence it suffices
      to prove that for any tree T of order n, its burning number $b(T) \\leq \\lceil
      \\sqrt{n} \\rceil$ where $T$ is the spanning tree of $G$. It was proved in 2018
      that $b(T) \\leq \\lceil \\sqrt{n + n_2 + 1/4} +1/2 \\rceil$ for a tree $T$
      where $n_2$ is the number of degree $2$ vertices in $T$. In this article, we
      give an algorithm to burn a tree and we improve the existing bound using this
      algorithm. We prove that $b(T)\\leq \\lceil \\sqrt{n + n_2 + 8}\\rceil -1$ which
      is an improved bound. Also, under certain restriction of degree $2$ vertices,
      we have improved upon the result of Bonato et al.(in 2021). We also provide

      "title": "Computing Subset Vertex Covers in H-Free Graphs", "abstract": "We
      consider a natural generalization of Vertex Cover: the Subset Vertex Cover problem,
      which is to decide for a graph $G=(V,E)$, a subset $T \\subseteq V$ and integer
      $k$, if $V$ has a subset $S$ of size at most $k$, such that $S$ contains at
      least one end-vertex of every edge incident to a vertex of $T$. A graph is $H$-free
      if it does not contain $H$ as an induced subgraph. We solve two open problems
      from the literature by proving that Subset Vertex Cover is NP-complete on subcubic
      (claw,diamond)-free planar graphs and on $2$-unipolar graphs, a subclass of
      $2P_3$-free weakly chordal graphs. Our results show for the first time that
      Subset Vertex Cover is computationally harder than Vertex Cover (under P $\\neq$
      NP). We also prove new polynomial time results. We first give a dichotomy on
      graphs where $G[T]$ is $H$-free. Namely, we show that Subset Vertex Cover is
      polynomial-time solvable on graphs $G$, for which $G[T]$ is $H$-free, if $H
      = sP_1 + tP_2$ and NP-complete otherwise. Moreover, we prove that Subset Vertex
      Cover is polynomial-time solvable for $(sP_1 + P_2 + P_3)$-free graphs and bounded
      mim-width graphs. By combining our new results with known results we obtain
      a partial complexity classification for Subset Vertex Cover on $H$-free graphs.",

      and their respective search trees are widely used in algorithmic graph theory.
      The problem whether a given spanning tree can be a graph search tree has been
      considered for different searches, graph classes and search tree paradigms.
      Similarly, the question whether a particular vertex can be visited last by some
      search has been studied extensively in recent years. We combine these two problems
      by considering the question whether a vertex can be a leaf of a graph search
      tree. We show that for particular search trees, including DFS trees, this problem
      is easy if we allow the leaf to be the first vertex of the search ordering.
      We contrast this result by showing that the problem becomes hard for many searches,
      including DFS and BFS, if we forbid the leaf to be the first vertex. Additionally,
      we present several structural and algorithmic results for search tree leaves

      "title": "The Unweighted and Weighted Reverse Shortest Path Problem for Disk
      Graphs", "abstract": "We study the reverse shortest path problem on disk graphs
      in the plane. In this problem we consider the proximity graph of a set of $n$
      disks in the plane of arbitrary radii: In this graph two disks are connected
      if the distance between them is at most some threshold parameter $r$. The case
      of intersection graphs is a special case with $r=0$. We give an algorithm that,
      given a target length $k$, computes the smallest value of $r$ for which there
      is a path of length at most $k$ between some given pair of disks in the proximity
      graph. Our algorithm runs in $O^*(n^{5/4})$ randomized expected time, which
      improves to $O^*(n^{6/5})$ for unit disk graphs, where all the disks have the
      same radius. Our technique is robust and can be applied to many variants of
      the problem. One significant variant is the case of weighted proximity graphs,
      where edges are assigned real weights equal to the distance between the disks
      or between their centers, and $k$ is replaced by a target weight $w$; that is,
      we seek a path whose length is at most $w$. In other variants, we want to optimize
      a parameter different from $r$, such as a scale factor of the radii of the disks.
      The main technique for the decision version of the problem (determining whether
      the graph with a given $r$ has the desired property) is based on efficient implementations
      of BFS (for the unweighted case) and of Dijkstra''s algorithm (for the weighted
      case), using efficient data structures for maintaining the bichromatic closest
      pair for certain bicliques and several distance functions. The optimization
      problem is then solved by combining the resulting decision procedure with enhanced
      variants of the interval shrinking and bifurcation technique of [4].", "venue":

      Problem", "abstract": "In this work, we study the Biclique-Free Vertex Deletion
      problem: Given a graph $G$ and integers $k$ and $i \\le j$, find a set of at
      most $k$ vertices that intersects every (not necessarily induced) biclique $K_{i,
      j}$ in $G$. This is a natural generalization of the Bounded-Degree Deletion
      problem, wherein one asks whether there is a set of at most $k$ vertices whose
      deletion results in a graph of a given maximum degree $r$. The two problems
      coincide when $i = 1$ and $j = r + 1$. We show that Biclique-Free Vertex Deletion
      is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to $k + d$ for the degeneracy $d$
      by developing a $2^{O(d k^2)} \\cdot n^{O(1)}$-time algorithm. We also show
      that it can be solved in $2^{O(f k)} \\cdot n^{O(1)}$ time for the feedback
      vertex number $f$ when $i \\ge 2$. In contrast, we find that it is W[1]-hard
      for the treedepth for any integer $i \\ge 1$. Finally, we show that Biclique-Free
      Vertex Deletion has a polynomial kernel for every $i \\ge 1$ when parameterized
      by the feedback edge number. Previously, for this parameter, its fixed-parameter
      tractability for $i = 1$ was known [Betzler et al., DAM ''12] but the existence
      of polynomial kernel was open.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

      consisting of a source generating updates and $n$ nodes connected in a two-dimensional
      square grid. The source keeps updates of a process, that might be generated
      or observed, and shares them with the grid network. The nodes in the grid network
      communicate with their neighbors and disseminate these version updates using
      a push-style gossip strategy. We use the version age metric to quantify the
      timeliness of information at the nodes. We find an upper bound for the average
      version age for a set of nodes in a general network. Using this, we show that
      the average version age at a node scales as $O(n^{\\frac{1}{3}})$ in a grid
      network. Prior to our work, it has been known that when $n$ nodes are connected
      on a ring the version age scales as $O(n^{\\frac{1}{2}})$, and when they are
      connected on a fully-connected graph the version age scales as $O(\\log n)$.
      Ours is the first work to show an age scaling result for a connectivity structure
      other than the ring and fully-connected networks that represent two extremes
      of network connectivity. Our work shows that higher connectivity on a grid compared

      Edges (SEFE) asks whether there exists a planar drawing for each input graph

      of two input graphs, the problem is NP-complete for $k \\geq 3$ [Schaefer, JGAA

      that SEFE is FPT with respect to $k$ plus the vertex cover number or the feedback

      Regarding the shared graph $G$, we show that SEFE is NP-complete, even if $G$
      is a tree with maximum degree 4. Together with a known NP-hardness reduction
      [Angelini et al., TCS 15], this allows us to conclude that several parameters

      the vertex cover number, and the number of cutvertices are intractable. We also
      settle the tractability of all pairs of these parameters. We give FPT algorithms

      possible. The construction of the second class of bigeodetic blocks described

      "title": "On Diameter Approximation in Directed Graphs", "abstract": "Computing
      the diameter of a graph, i.e. the largest distance, is a fundamental problem
      that is central in fine-grained complexity. In undirected graphs, the Strong
      Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) yields a lower bound on the time vs. approximation
      trade-off that is quite close to the upper bounds. In \\emph{directed} graphs,
      however, where only some of the upper bounds apply, much larger gaps remain.
      Since $d(u,v)$ may not be the same as $d(v,u)$, there are multiple ways to define
      the problem, the two most natural being the \\emph{(one-way) diameter} ($\\max_{(u,v)}
      d(u,v)$) and the \\emph{roundtrip diameter} ($\\max_{u,v} d(u,v)+d(v,u)$). In
      this paper we make progress on the outstanding open question for each of them.
      -- We design the first algorithm for diameter in sparse directed graphs to achieve
      $n^{1.5-\\varepsilon}$ time with an approximation factor better than $2$. The
      new upper bound trade-off makes the directed case appear more similar to the
      undirected case. Notably, this is the first algorithm for diameter in sparse
      graphs that benefits from fast matrix multiplication. -- We design new hardness
      reductions separating roundtrip diameter from directed and undirected diameter.
      In particular, a $1.5$-approximation in subquadratic time would refute the All-Nodes
      $k$-Cycle hypothesis, and any $(2-\\varepsilon)$-approximation would imply a
      breakthrough algorithm for approximate $\\ell_{\\infty}$-Closest-Pair. Notably,

      is to find a sequence of nodes from $V$, called a burning sequence, to burn
      the whole graph. This is a discrete-step process, and at each step, an unburned
      vertex is selected as an agent to spread fire to its neighbors by marking it
      as a burnt node. A burnt node spreads the fire to its neighbors at the next
      consecutive step. The goal is to find the burning sequence of minimum length.
      The Graph Burning problem is NP-Hard for general graphs and even for binary
      trees. A few approximation results are known, including a $ 3$-approximation
      algorithm for general graphs and a $ 2$-approximation algorithm for trees. The
      Graph Burning on directed graphs is more challenging than on undirected graphs.
      In this paper, we propose 1) A $2.75$-approximation algorithm for a cactus graph
      (undirected), 2) A $3$-approximation algorithm for multi-rooted directed trees
      (polytree) and 3) A $1.905$-approximation algorithm for single-rooted directed

      how the relationship between non-equivalent width parameters changes once we

      whereas as graph classes we consider $K_{t,t}$-subgraph-free graphs, line graphs
      and their common superclass, for $t \\geq 3$, of $K_{t,t}$-free graphs. We first
      provide a complete comparison when restricted to $K_{t,t}$-subgraph-free graphs,
      showing in particular that treewidth, clique-width, mim-width, sim-width and
      tree-independence number are all equivalent. This extends a result of Gurski
      and Wanke (2000) stating that treewidth and clique-width are equivalent for
      the class of $K_{t,t}$-subgraph-free graphs. Next, we provide a complete comparison
      when restricted to line graphs, showing in particular that, on any class of
      line graphs, clique-width, mim-width, sim-width and tree-independence number
      are all equivalent, and bounded if and only if the class of root graphs has

      "title": "Shortcut Partitions in Minor-Free Graphs: Steiner Point Removal, Distance
      Oracles, Tree Covers, and More", "abstract": "The notion of shortcut partition,
      introduced recently by Chang, Conroy, Le, Milenkovi\\''c, Solomon, and Than
      [CCLMST23], is a new type of graph partition into low-diameter clusters. Roughly
      speaking, the shortcut partition guarantees that for every two vertices $u$
      and $v$ in the graph, there exists a path between $u$ and $v$ that intersects
      only a few clusters. They proved that any planar graph admits a shortcut partition
      and gave several applications, including a construction of tree cover for arbitrary
      planar graphs with stretch $1+\\varepsilon$ and $O(1)$ many trees for any fixed
      $\\varepsilon \\in (0,1)$. However, the construction heavily exploits planarity
      in multiple steps, and is thus inherently limited to planar graphs. In this
      work, we breach the\"planarity barrier\"to construct a shortcut partition for
      $K_r$-minor-free graphs for any $r$. To this end, we take a completely different
      approach -- our key contribution is a novel deterministic variant of the cop
      decomposition in minor-free graphs [And86, AGG14]. Our shortcut partition for
      $K_r$-minor-free graphs yields several direct applications. Most notably, we
      construct the first optimal distance oracle for $K_r$-minor-free graphs, with
      $1+\\varepsilon$ stretch, linear space, and constant query time for any fixed
      $\\varepsilon \\in (0,1)$. The previous best distance oracle [AG06] uses $O(n\\log
      n)$ space and $O(\\log n)$ query time, and its construction relies on Robertson-Seymour
      structural theorem and other sophisticated tools. We also obtain the first tree
      cover of $O(1)$ size for minor-free graphs with stretch $1+\\varepsilon$, while
      the previous best $(1+\\varepsilon)$-tree cover has size $O(\\log^2 n)$ [BFN19].",

      "title": "The nature of hypergraph $k$-core percolation problems", "abstract":
      "We develop the theory of $k$-cores in hypergraphs based on the assumption that
      a hyperedge can only be intact if all its nodes are undamaged. This scenario
      applies for instance to supply chains where the production of a product requires
      all raw materials and all processing steps; in biology it applies to protein-interaction
      networks where protein complexes can only function if all the proteins are present,
      and it applies as well to chemical reaction networks where a chemical reaction
      can take place only when all the reactants are present. Formulating a message-passing
      theory for hypergraph $k$-core percolation, and combining it with the theory
      of critical phenomena on networks we demonstrate that the set of $k$-core problems
      for locally tree-like hypergraphs is much richer than for ordinary graphs. In
      particular we define a pruning process acting on nodes as well as on hyperedges
      depending on their connectivity and we demonstrate sharp differences with previously
      studied factor graph $k$-core percolation processes where it is allow for hyperedges

      that path includes the maximum number of colors. We analyze the approximation

      multiple recent publications in the field adapt existing labeling methods in
      an ad-hoc fashion to their specific problem variant without considering the
      underlying general structure: they always deal with multi-criteria scenarios

      we introduce the partial order shortest path problem (POSP), a generalization
      of the multi-objective shortest path problem (MOSP) and in turn also of the
      classical shortest path problem. POSP captures the particular structure of many
      shortest path applications as special cases. In this generality, we study optimality

      "title": "The Complexity of Cluster Vertex Splitting and Company", "abstract":
      "Clustering a graph when the clusters can overlap can be seen from three different
      angles: We may look for cliques that cover the edges of the graph, we may look
      to add or delete few edges to uncover the cluster structure, or we may split
      vertices to separate the clusters from each other. Splitting a vertex $v$ means
      to remove it and to add two new copies of $v$ and to make each previous neighbor
      of $v$ adjacent with at least one of the copies. In this work, we study the
      underlying computational problems regarding the three angles to overlapping
      clusterings, in particular when the overlap is small. We show that the above-mentioned
      covering problem, which also has been independently studied in different contexts,is
      NP-complete. Based on a previous so-called critical-clique lemma, we leverage
      our hardness result to show that Cluster Editing with Vertex Splitting is also
      NP-complete, resolving an open question by Abu-Khzam et al. [ISCO 2018]. We
      notice, however, that the proof of the critical-clique lemma is flawed and we
      give a counterexample. Our hardness result also holds under a version of the
      critical-clique lemma to which we currently do not have a counterexample. On
      the positive side, we show that Cluster Vertex Splitting admits a vertex-linear
      problem kernel with respect to the number of splits.", "venue": "", "year":

      "We present a linear-time algorithm that, given as input (i) a bipartite Pfaffian
      graph $G$ of minimum degree three, (ii) a Hamiltonian cycle $H$ in $G$, and
      (iii) an edge $e$ in $H$, outputs at least three other Hamiltonian cycles through
      the edge $e$ in $G$. This linear-time complexity of finding another Hamiltonian
      cycle given one is in sharp contrast to the problem of deciding the existence
      of a Hamiltonian cycle, which is NP-complete already for cubic bipartite planar
      graphs; such graphs are Pfaffian. Also, without the degree requirement, we show
      that it is NP-hard to find another Hamiltonian cycle in a bipartite Pfaffian
      graph. We present further improved algorithms for finding optimal traveling
      salesperson tours and counting Hamiltonian cycles in bipartite planar graphs
      with running times that are not known to hold in general planar graphs. We prove
      our results by a new structural technique that efficiently witnesses each Hamiltonian
      cycle $H$ through an arbitrary fixed anchor edge $e$ in a bipartite Pfaffian
      graph using a two-coloring of the vertices as advice that is unique to $H$.
      Previous techniques -- the Cut&Count technique of Cygan et al. [FOCS''11, TALG''22]
      in particular -- were able to reduce the Hamiltonian cycle problem only to essentially
      counting problems; our results show that counting can be avoided by leveraging
      properties of bipartite Pfaffian graphs. Our technique also has purely graph-theoretical
      consequences; for example, we show that every cubic bipartite Pfaffian graph
      has either zero or at least six distinct Hamiltonian cycles; the latter case

      paths such that the $i$-th path connects $s_i$ to $t_i$. We study the problem
      through the lens of kernelization, aiming at efficiently reducing the input

      "title": "Redicolouring digraphs: directed treewidth and cycle-degeneracy",
      "abstract": "Given a digraph $D=(V,A)$ on $n$ vertices and a vertex $v\\in V$,
      the cycle-degree of $v$ is the minimum size of a set $S \\subseteq V(D) \\setminus
      \\{v\\}$ intersecting every directed cycle of $D$ containing $v$. From this
      definition of cycle-degree, we define the $c$-degeneracy (or cycle-degeneracy)
      of $D$, which we denote by $\\delta^*_c(D)$. It appears to be a nice generalisation
      of the undirected degeneracy. In this work, using this new definition of cycle-degeneracy,
      we extend several evidences for Cereceda''s conjecture to digraphs. The $k$-dicolouring
      graph of $D$, denoted by $\\mathcal{D}_k(D)$, is the undirected graph whose
      vertices are the $k$-dicolourings of $D$ and in which two $k$-dicolourings are
      adjacent if they differ on the colour of exactly one vertex. We show that $\\mathcal{D}_k(D)$
      has diameter at most $O_{\\delta^*_c(D)}(n^{\\delta^*_c(D) + 1})$ (respectively
      $O(n^2)$ and $(\\delta^*_c(D)+1)$) when $k$ is at least $\\delta^*_c(D)+2$ (respectively
      $\\frac{3}{2}(\\delta^*_c(D)+1)$ and $2(\\delta^*_c(D)+1)$). This improves known
      results on digraph redicolouring (Bousquet et al.). Next, we extend a result
      due to Feghali to digraphs, showing that $\\mathcal{D}_{d+1}(D)$ has diameter
      at most $O_{d,\\epsilon}(n(\\log n)^{d-1})$ when $D$ has maximum average cycle-degree
      at most $d-\\epsilon$. We then show that two proofs of Bonamy and Bousquet for
      undirected graphs can be extended to digraphs. The first one uses the digrundy
      number of a digraph and the second one uses the $\\mathscr{D}$-width. Finally,
      we give a general theorem which makes a connection between the recolourability
      of a digraph $D$ and the recolourability of its underlying graph $UG(D)$. This
      result directly extends a number of results on planar graph recolouring to planar
      digraph redicolouring.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

      "The twin-width of a graph measures its distance to co-graphs and generalizes
      classical width concepts such as tree-width or rank-width. Since its introduction
      in 2020 (Bonnet et. al. 2020), a mass of new results has appeared relating twin
      width to group theory, model theory, combinatorial optimization, and structural
      graph theory. We take a detailed look at the interplay between the twin-width
      of a graph and the twin-width of its components under tree-structured decompositions:
      We prove that the twin-width of a graph is at most twice its strong tree-width,
      contrasting nicely with the result of (Bonnet and D\\''epr\\''es 2022), which
      states that twin-width can be exponential in tree-width. Further, we employ
      the fundamental concept from structural graph theory of decomposing a graph
      into highly connected components, in order to obtain an optimal linear bound
      on the twin-width of a graph given the widths of its biconnected components.
      For triconnected components we obtain a linear upper bound if we add red edges
      to the components indicating the splits which led to the components. Extending
      this approach to quasi-4-connectivity, we obtain a quadratic upper bound. Finally,

      "title": "Balanced Separator Theorem for Unit Disk Graphs with Applications",
      "abstract": ". In this paper, we establish a novel balanced separator theorem
      for Unit Disk Graphs (UDGs) , which mimics the well-known Lipton and Tarjan\u2019s
      planar balanced shortest paths separator theorem. We prove that, in any n -vertex
      UDG G , one can \ufb01nd two hop-shortest paths P ( s, x ) and P ( s, y ) such
      that the removal of the 3-hop-neighborhood of these paths (i.e., N 3 G [ P (
      s, x ) \u222a P ( s, y )]) from G leaves no connected component with more than
      2 / 3 n vertices. This new balanced shortest-paths\u20143-hop-neighborhood separator
      theorem allows us to build, for any n -vertex UDG G , a system T ( G ) of at
      most 2 log 3 2 n + 2 spanning trees of G such that, for any two vertices x and
      y of G , there exists a tree T in T ( G ) with d T ( x, y ) \u2264 3 \u00b7
      d G ( x, y ) + 12. That is, the distances in any UDG can be approximately represented
      by the distances in at most 2 log 32 n + 2 of its spanning trees. Using these
      results, we propose a new compact and low delay routing labeling scheme for
      UDGs. They often model wireless ad hoc networks. We show that one can assign
      each vertex of an n -vertex UDG G a compact O (log 2 n )-bit label such that,
      given the label of a source vertex and the label of a destination, it is possible
      to compute e\ufb03ciently, based solely on these two labels, a neighbor of the
      source vertex that heads in the direction of the destination. We prove that
      this routing labeling scheme has a constant hop route-stretch (= hop delay ),
      i.e., for each two vertices x and y of G , it produces a routing path with h
      ( x, y ) hops (edges) such that h ( x, y ) \u2264 3 \u00b7 d G ( x, y ) + 12,
      where d G ( x, y ) is the hop distance between x and y in G . To the best of
      our knowledge, this is the \ufb01rst compact routing scheme for UDGs which not
      only guaranties delivery but has a low hop delay. It is easy to see that, for
      UDGs, a constant hop route-stretch implies a constant length route-stretch and
      a constant power route-stretch .", "venue": "", "year": 2008, "referenceCount":

      this paper, we introduce a new problem of comparing two given labeled graphs,

      string in the constraint labeled graph $G_3 = (V_3, E_3)$ as its subsequence.
      Firstly, we consider the case where $G_1$, $G_2$ and $G_3$ are all acyclic,

      In a min-$k$-planar drawing edges can cross an arbitrary number of times, but
      for any two crossing edges, one of the two must have no more than $k$ crossings.
      We prove a general upper bound on the number of edges of min-$k$-planar drawings,
      a finer upper bound for $k=3$, and tight upper bounds for $k=1,2$. Also, we
      study the inclusion relations between min-$k$-planar graphs (i.e., graphs admitting
      min-$k$-planar drawings) and $k$-planar graphs.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year":

      we are given an $n$-node, $m$-edge input graph $G$, and the goal is to compute
      a spanning subgraph $H$ on $O(n)$ edges. This can be achieved in linear $O(m
      + n)$ time via breadth-first search. But can we hope for \\emph{sublinear} runtime
      in some range of parameters? If the goal is to return $H$ as an adjacency list,
      there are simple lower bounds showing that $\\Omega(m + n)$ runtime is necessary.
      If the goal is to return $H$ as an adjacency matrix, then we need $\\Omega(n^2)$
      time just to write down the entries of the output matrix. However, we show that
      neither of these lower bounds still apply if instead the goal is to return $H$
      as an \\emph{implicit} adjacency matrix, which we call an \\emph{adjacency oracle}.
      An adjacency oracle is a data structure that gives a user the illusion that
      an adjacency matrix has been computed: it accepts edge queries $(u, v)$, and
      it returns in near-constant time a bit indicating whether $(u, v) \\in E(H)$.
      Our main result is that one can construct an adjacency oracle for a spanning
      subgraph on at most $(1+\\varepsilon)n$ edges, in $\\tilde{O}(n \\varepsilon^{-1})$
      time, and that this construction time is near-optimal. Additional results include
      constructions of adjacency oracles for $k$-connectivity certificates and spanners,
      which are similarly sublinear on dense-enough input graphs. Our adjacency oracles
      are closely related to Local Computation Algorithms (LCAs) for graph sparsifiers;
      they can be viewed as LCAs with some computation moved to a preprocessing step,
      in order to speed up queries. Our oracles imply the first Local algorithm for
      computing sparse spanning subgraphs of general input graphs in $\\tilde{O}(n)$
      query time, which works by constructing our adjacency oracle, querying it once,
      and then throwing the rest of the oracle away. This addresses an open problem

      Acyclic Graphs", "abstract": "Graphs and graph unions. We mostly follow the
      graph theory terminology of Andersson et al. [1997]. A graph is undirected if
      all its edges are undirected, directed if all its edges are directed, and partially
      directed if it contains both directed and undirected edges. A directed graph
      that has no directed cycle is called a directed acyclic graph (DAG). A generalization
      of this idea is that of chain graphs: a partially directed graph is called a
      chain graph if it has no cycle which contains (i) at least one directed edge,
      and (ii) in which all directed edges are directed in the same direction as one
      moves along the cycle. We denote the neighbors of a vertex v in a graph G as
      NG(v), and an induced subgraph of G on a set X \u2286 V is denoted as G[X].
      The graph union (which we just call \u201cunion\u201d) G1 \u222aG2 includes
      vertices and edges present in any one of G1 or G2, i.e., VG1\u222aG2 = VG1 \u222aVG2
      , and EG1\u222aG2 = EG1 \u222aEG2 . The skeleton of a partially directed graph
      G is an undirected version of G which we get by ignoring the direction of all
      the edges: in particular, note that the skeleton of a partially directed graph
      is also the graph union of all the partially directed graphs with the same skeleton
      as G. A v-structure (or unshielded collider) in a partially directed graph G

      the aim is to find an $(s,t)$-path with odd length and, among all such paths,
      of minimum weight. For the case when the weight function is conservative, i.e.,
      when every cycle has non-negative total weight, the complexity of the Shortest
      Odd Path problem had been open for 20 years, and was recently shown to be NP-hard.
      We give a polynomial-time algorithm for the special case when the weight function
      is conservative and the set $E^-$ of negative-weight edges forms a single tree.
      Our algorithm exploits the strong connection between Shortest Odd Path and the
      problem of finding two internally vertex-disjoint paths between two terminals
      in an undirected edge-weighted graph. It also relies on solving an intermediary
      problem variant called Shortest Parity-Constrained Odd Path where for certain
      edges we have parity constraints on their position along the path. Also, we
      exhibit two FPT algorithms for solving Shortest Odd Path in graphs with conservative

      "title": "Burning a binary tree and its generalization", "abstract": "Graph
      burning is a graph process that models the spread of social contagion. Initially,
      all the vertices of a graph G are unburnt. At each step, an unburnt vertex is
      put on fire and the fire from burnt vertices of the previous step spreads to
      their adjacent unburnt vertices. This process continues till all vertices are
      burnt. The burning number $b(G)$ of the graph $G$ is the minimum number of steps
      required to burn all the vertices in the graph. The burning number conjecture
      by Bonato et al. states that for a connected graph G of order n, its burning
      number $b(G) \\leq \\lceil \\sqrt{n} \\rceil$. It is easy to observe that in
      order to burn a graph it is enough to burn its spanning tree. Hence it suffices
      to prove that for any tree T of order n, its burning number $b(T) \\leq \\lceil
      \\sqrt{n} \\rceil$ where $T$ is the spanning tree of $G$. It was proved in 2018
      that $b(T) \\leq \\lceil \\sqrt{n + n_2 + 1/4} +1/2 \\rceil$ for a tree $T$
      where $n_2$ is the number of degree $2$ vertices in $T$. In this article, we
      give an algorithm to burn a tree and we improve the existing bound using this
      algorithm. We prove that $b(T)\\leq \\lceil \\sqrt{n + n_2 + 8}\\rceil -1$ which
      is an improved bound. Also, under certain restriction of degree $2$ vertices,

      "title": "Computing Subset Vertex Covers in H-Free Graphs", "abstract": "We
      consider a natural generalization of Vertex Cover: the Subset Vertex Cover problem,
      which is to decide for a graph $G=(V,E)$, a subset $T \\subseteq V$ and integer
      $k$, if $V$ has a subset $S$ of size at most $k$, such that $S$ contains at
      least one end-vertex of every edge incident to a vertex of $T$. A graph is $H$-free
      if it does not contain $H$ as an induced subgraph. We solve two open problems
      from the literature by proving that Subset Vertex Cover is NP-complete on subcubic
      (claw,diamond)-free planar graphs and on $2$-unipolar graphs, a subclass of
      $2P_3$-free weakly chordal graphs. Our results show for the first time that
      Subset Vertex Cover is computationally harder than Vertex Cover (under P $\\neq$
      NP). We also prove new polynomial time results. We first give a dichotomy on
      graphs where $G[T]$ is $H$-free. Namely, we show that Subset Vertex Cover is
      polynomial-time solvable on graphs $G$, for which $G[T]$ is $H$-free, if $H
      = sP_1 + tP_2$ and NP-complete otherwise. Moreover, we prove that Subset Vertex
      Cover is polynomial-time solvable for $(sP_1 + P_2 + P_3)$-free graphs and bounded
      mim-width graphs. By combining our new results with known results we obtain
      a partial complexity classification for Subset Vertex Cover on $H$-free graphs.",

      and their respective search trees are widely used in algorithmic graph theory.
      The problem whether a given spanning tree can be a graph search tree has been
      considered for different searches, graph classes and search tree paradigms.
      Similarly, the question whether a particular vertex can be visited last by some
      search has been studied extensively in recent years. We combine these two problems
      by considering the question whether a vertex can be a leaf of a graph search
      tree. We show that for particular search trees, including DFS trees, this problem
      is easy if we allow the leaf to be the first vertex of the search ordering.
      We contrast this result by showing that the problem becomes hard for many searches,
      including DFS and BFS, if we forbid the leaf to be the first vertex. Additionally,
      we present several structural and algorithmic results for search tree leaves

      "title": "The Unweighted and Weighted Reverse Shortest Path Problem for Disk
      Graphs", "abstract": "We study the reverse shortest path problem on disk graphs
      in the plane. In this problem we consider the proximity graph of a set of $n$
      disks in the plane of arbitrary radii: In this graph two disks are connected
      if the distance between them is at most some threshold parameter $r$. The case
      of intersection graphs is a special case with $r=0$. We give an algorithm that,
      given a target length $k$, computes the smallest value of $r$ for which there
      is a path of length at most $k$ between some given pair of disks in the proximity
      graph. Our algorithm runs in $O^*(n^{5/4})$ randomized expected time, which
      improves to $O^*(n^{6/5})$ for unit disk graphs, where all the disks have the
      same radius. Our technique is robust and can be applied to many variants of
      the problem. One significant variant is the case of weighted proximity graphs,
      where edges are assigned real weights equal to the distance between the disks
      or between their centers, and $k$ is replaced by a target weight $w$; that is,
      we seek a path whose length is at most $w$. In other variants, we want to optimize
      a parameter different from $r$, such as a scale factor of the radii of the disks.
      The main technique for the decision version of the problem (determining whether
      the graph with a given $r$ has the desired property) is based on efficient implementations
      of BFS (for the unweighted case) and of Dijkstra''s algorithm (for the weighted
      case), using efficient data structures for maintaining the bichromatic closest
      pair for certain bicliques and several distance functions. The optimization
      problem is then solved by combining the resulting decision procedure with enhanced
      variants of the interval shrinking and bifurcation technique of [4].", "venue":

      set of a graph G. It provides concrete realizations and exact values for the
      restrained dr-power domination number within specific graph classes, such as
      path and cycle graphs, as well as in the context of join and corona operations.

      study the knapsack problem with graph theoretic constraints. That is, we assume
      that there exists a graph structure on the set of items of knapsack and the

      knapsack constraints. In particular, we need to compute in the connected knapsack
      problem a connected subset of items which has maximum value subject to the size
      of knapsack constraint. We show that this problem is strongly NP-complete even
      for graphs of maximum degree four and NP-complete even for star graphs. On the
      other hand, we develop an algorithm running in time $O\\left(2^{tw\\log tw}\\cdot\\text{poly}(\\min\\{s^2,d^2\\})\\right)$

      theory and enumerative combinatorics are two branches of mathematical sciences

      a shortest path between two nodes in an undirected unweighted graph is among

      In this work, we extend these results by giving sublinear time shortest path

      "title": "On Diameter Approximation in Directed Graphs", "abstract": "Computing
      the diameter of a graph, i.e. the largest distance, is a fundamental problem
      that is central in fine-grained complexity. In undirected graphs, the Strong
      Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) yields a lower bound on the time vs. approximation
      trade-off that is quite close to the upper bounds. In \\emph{directed} graphs,
      however, where only some of the upper bounds apply, much larger gaps remain.
      Since $d(u,v)$ may not be the same as $d(v,u)$, there are multiple ways to define
      the problem, the two most natural being the \\emph{(one-way) diameter} ($\\max_{(u,v)}
      d(u,v)$) and the \\emph{roundtrip diameter} ($\\max_{u,v} d(u,v)+d(v,u)$). In
      this paper we make progress on the outstanding open question for each of them.
      -- We design the first algorithm for diameter in sparse directed graphs to achieve
      $n^{1.5-\\varepsilon}$ time with an approximation factor better than $2$. The
      new upper bound trade-off makes the directed case appear more similar to the
      undirected case. Notably, this is the first algorithm for diameter in sparse
      graphs that benefits from fast matrix multiplication. -- We design new hardness
      reductions separating roundtrip diameter from directed and undirected diameter.
      In particular, a $1.5$-approximation in subquadratic time would refute the All-Nodes
      $k$-Cycle hypothesis, and any $(2-\\varepsilon)$-approximation would imply a
      breakthrough algorithm for approximate $\\ell_{\\infty}$-Closest-Pair. Notably,
      these are the first conditional lower bounds for diameter that are not based
      on SETH.", "venue": "Embedded Systems and Applications", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

      "title": "Approximation Algorithms for the Graph Burning on Cactus and Directed
      Trees", "abstract": "Given a graph $G=(V, E)$, the problem of Graph Burning
      is to find a sequence of nodes from $V$, called a burning sequence, to burn
      the whole graph. This is a discrete-step process, and at each step, an unburned
      vertex is selected as an agent to spread fire to its neighbors by marking it
      as a burnt node. A burnt node spreads the fire to its neighbors at the next
      consecutive step. The goal is to find the burning sequence of minimum length.
      The Graph Burning problem is NP-Hard for general graphs and even for binary
      trees. A few approximation results are known, including a $ 3$-approximation
      algorithm for general graphs and a $ 2$-approximation algorithm for trees. The
      Graph Burning on directed graphs is more challenging than on undirected graphs.
      In this paper, we propose 1) A $2.75$-approximation algorithm for a cactus graph
      (undirected), 2) A $3$-approximation algorithm for multi-rooted directed trees
      (polytree) and 3) A $1.905$-approximation algorithm for single-rooted directed
      tree (arborescence). We implement all the three approximation algorithms and
      the results are shown for randomly generated cactus graphs and directed trees.",

      Therefore, it is pertinent to merge these concepts to derive the domination

      a is defined as the minimum cardinality of a minimal dominating set that includes
      a. The idea of domination degree and domination index is conducted of graphs
      like complete graphs, complete bipartite, r partite graphs, cycles, wheels,
      paths, book graphs, windmill graphs, Kragujevac trees. The study is extended
      to operation in graphs. Inequalities involving domination degree and already

      "title": "Shortcut Partitions in Minor-Free Graphs: Steiner Point Removal, Distance
      Oracles, Tree Covers, and More", "abstract": "The notion of shortcut partition,
      introduced recently by Chang, Conroy, Le, Milenkovi\\''c, Solomon, and Than
      [CCLMST23], is a new type of graph partition into low-diameter clusters. Roughly
      speaking, the shortcut partition guarantees that for every two vertices $u$
      and $v$ in the graph, there exists a path between $u$ and $v$ that intersects
      only a few clusters. They proved that any planar graph admits a shortcut partition
      and gave several applications, including a construction of tree cover for arbitrary
      planar graphs with stretch $1+\\varepsilon$ and $O(1)$ many trees for any fixed
      $\\varepsilon \\in (0,1)$. However, the construction heavily exploits planarity
      in multiple steps, and is thus inherently limited to planar graphs. In this
      work, we breach the\"planarity barrier\"to construct a shortcut partition for
      $K_r$-minor-free graphs for any $r$. To this end, we take a completely different
      approach -- our key contribution is a novel deterministic variant of the cop
      decomposition in minor-free graphs [And86, AGG14]. Our shortcut partition for
      $K_r$-minor-free graphs yields several direct applications. Most notably, we
      construct the first optimal distance oracle for $K_r$-minor-free graphs, with
      $1+\\varepsilon$ stretch, linear space, and constant query time for any fixed
      $\\varepsilon \\in (0,1)$. The previous best distance oracle [AG06] uses $O(n\\log
      n)$ space and $O(\\log n)$ query time, and its construction relies on Robertson-Seymour
      structural theorem and other sophisticated tools. We also obtain the first tree
      cover of $O(1)$ size for minor-free graphs with stretch $1+\\varepsilon$, while
      the previous best $(1+\\varepsilon)$-tree cover has size $O(\\log^2 n)$ [BFN19].",

      "We develop the theory of $k$-cores in hypergraphs based on the assumption that
      a hyperedge can only be intact if all its nodes are undamaged. This scenario
      applies for instance to supply chains where the production of a product requires
      all raw materials and all processing steps; in biology it applies to protein-interaction
      networks where protein complexes can only function if all the proteins are present,
      and it applies as well to chemical reaction networks where a chemical reaction
      can take place only when all the reactants are present. Formulating a message-passing
      theory for hypergraph $k$-core percolation, and combining it with the theory
      of critical phenomena on networks we demonstrate that the set of $k$-core problems
      for locally tree-like hypergraphs is much richer than for ordinary graphs. In
      particular we define a pruning process acting on nodes as well as on hyperedges
      depending on their connectivity and we demonstrate sharp differences with previously
      studied factor graph $k$-core percolation processes where it is allow for hyperedges
      to have one or more damaged nodes and still be intact. Furthermore we define
      a set of pruning processes that act either exclusively on nodes or exclusively
      on hyperedges and depend of their second-neighborhood connectivity. We show
      that the resulting second-neighbor $k$-core percolation problems are significantly
      distinct with each other and we reveal their relation to hypergraph and factor
      graph $k$-core percolation problems.", "venue": "", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

      Finding paths is a fundamental problem in graph theory and algorithm design
      due to its many applications. Recently, this problem has been considered on
      temporal graphs, where edges may change over a discrete time domain. The analysis
      of graphs has also taken into account the relevance of vertex properties, modeled
      by assigning to vertices labels or colors. In this work, we deal with a problem
      that, given a static or temporal graph, whose vertices are colored graph looks
      for a path such that (1) the vertices of the path have distinct colors and (2)
      that path includes the maximum number of colors. We analyze the approximation
      complexity of the problem on static and temporal graphs, and we prove an inapproximability
      bound. Then, we consider the problem on temporal graphs, and we design a heuristic
      for it. We present an experimental evaluation of our heuristic, both on synthetic
      and real-world graphs. The experimental results show that for many instances
      of the problem, our method is able to return near-optimal solutions.", "venue":

      the models and assessing the optimality of paths become more complicated. Hence,
      multiple recent publications in the field adapt existing labeling methods in
      an ad-hoc fashion to their specific problem variant without considering the
      underlying general structure: they always deal with multi-criteria scenarios
      and those criteria define different partial orders on the paths. In this paper,
      we introduce the partial order shortest path problem (POSP), a generalization
      of the multi-objective shortest path problem (MOSP) and in turn also of the
      classical shortest path problem. POSP captures the particular structure of many
      shortest path applications as special cases. In this generality, we study optimality
      conditions or the lack of them, depending on the objective functions'' properties.
      Our final contribution is a big lookup table summarizing our findings and providing
      the reader an easy way to choose among the most recent multicriteria shortest

      from time-dependent shortest path and bottleneck path problems to the fuzzy
      shortest path problem and complex financial weight functions studied in the

      "Clustering a graph when the clusters can overlap can be seen from three different
      angles: We may look for cliques that cover the edges of the graph, we may look
      to add or delete few edges to uncover the cluster structure, or we may split
      vertices to separate the clusters from each other. Splitting a vertex $v$ means
      to remove it and to add two new copies of $v$ and to make each previous neighbor
      of $v$ adjacent with at least one of the copies. In this work, we study the
      underlying computational problems regarding the three angles to overlapping
      clusterings, in particular when the overlap is small. We show that the above-mentioned
      covering problem, which also has been independently studied in different contexts,is
      NP-complete. Based on a previous so-called critical-clique lemma, we leverage
      our hardness result to show that Cluster Editing with Vertex Splitting is also
      NP-complete, resolving an open question by Abu-Khzam et al. [ISCO 2018]. We
      notice, however, that the proof of the critical-clique lemma is flawed and we
      give a counterexample. Our hardness result also holds under a version of the

      "We present a linear-time algorithm that, given as input (i) a bipartite Pfaffian
      graph $G$ of minimum degree three, (ii) a Hamiltonian cycle $H$ in $G$, and
      (iii) an edge $e$ in $H$, outputs at least three other Hamiltonian cycles through
      the edge $e$ in $G$. This linear-time complexity of finding another Hamiltonian
      cycle given one is in sharp contrast to the problem of deciding the existence
      of a Hamiltonian cycle, which is NP-complete already for cubic bipartite planar
      graphs; such graphs are Pfaffian. Also, without the degree requirement, we show
      that it is NP-hard to find another Hamiltonian cycle in a bipartite Pfaffian
      graph. We present further improved algorithms for finding optimal traveling
      salesperson tours and counting Hamiltonian cycles in bipartite planar graphs
      with running times that are not known to hold in general planar graphs. We prove
      our results by a new structural technique that efficiently witnesses each Hamiltonian
      cycle $H$ through an arbitrary fixed anchor edge $e$ in a bipartite Pfaffian
      graph using a two-coloring of the vertices as advice that is unique to $H$.
      Previous techniques -- the Cut&Count technique of Cygan et al. [FOCS''11, TALG''22]
      in particular -- were able to reduce the Hamiltonian cycle problem only to essentially
      counting problems; our results show that counting can be avoided by leveraging
      properties of bipartite Pfaffian graphs. Our technique also has purely graph-theoretical

      Planar Disjoint Paths problem, one is given an undirected planar graph with
      a set of $k$ vertex pairs $(s_i,t_i)$ and the task is to find $k$ pairwise vertex-disjoint
      paths such that the $i$-th path connects $s_i$ to $t_i$. We study the problem
      through the lens of kernelization, aiming at efficiently reducing the input
      size in terms of a parameter. We show that Planar Disjoint Paths does not admit
      a polynomial kernel when parameterized by $k$ unless coNP $\\subseteq$ NP/poly,
      resolving an open problem by [Bodlaender, Thomass{\\''e}, Yeo, ESA''09]. Moreover,
      we rule out the existence of a polynomial Turing kernel unless the WK-hierarchy
      collapses. Our reduction carries over to the setting of edge-disjoint paths,
      where the kernelization status remained open even in general graphs. On the
      positive side, we present a polynomial kernel for Planar Disjoint Paths parameterized
      by $k + tw$, where $tw$ denotes the treewidth of the input graph. As a consequence
      of both our results, we rule out the possibility of a polynomial-time (Turing)
      treewidth reduction to $tw= k^{O(1)}$ under the same assumptions. To the best
      of our knowledge, this is the first hardness result of this kind. Finally, combining
      our kernel with the known techniques [Adler, Kolliopoulos, Krause, Lokshtanov,

      "title": "Redicolouring digraphs: directed treewidth and cycle-degeneracy",
      "abstract": "Given a digraph $D=(V,A)$ on $n$ vertices and a vertex $v\\in V$,
      the cycle-degree of $v$ is the minimum size of a set $S \\subseteq V(D) \\setminus
      \\{v\\}$ intersecting every directed cycle of $D$ containing $v$. From this
      definition of cycle-degree, we define the $c$-degeneracy (or cycle-degeneracy)
      of $D$, which we denote by $\\delta^*_c(D)$. It appears to be a nice generalisation
      of the undirected degeneracy. In this work, using this new definition of cycle-degeneracy,
      we extend several evidences for Cereceda''s conjecture to digraphs. The $k$-dicolouring
      graph of $D$, denoted by $\\mathcal{D}_k(D)$, is the undirected graph whose
      vertices are the $k$-dicolourings of $D$ and in which two $k$-dicolourings are
      adjacent if they differ on the colour of exactly one vertex. We show that $\\mathcal{D}_k(D)$
      has diameter at most $O_{\\delta^*_c(D)}(n^{\\delta^*_c(D) + 1})$ (respectively
      $O(n^2)$ and $(\\delta^*_c(D)+1)$) when $k$ is at least $\\delta^*_c(D)+2$ (respectively
      $\\frac{3}{2}(\\delta^*_c(D)+1)$ and $2(\\delta^*_c(D)+1)$). This improves known
      results on digraph redicolouring (Bousquet et al.). Next, we extend a result
      due to Feghali to digraphs, showing that $\\mathcal{D}_{d+1}(D)$ has diameter
      at most $O_{d,\\epsilon}(n(\\log n)^{d-1})$ when $D$ has maximum average cycle-degree
      at most $d-\\epsilon$. We then show that two proofs of Bonamy and Bousquet for
      undirected graphs can be extended to digraphs. The first one uses the digrundy
      number of a digraph and the second one uses the $\\mathscr{D}$-width. Finally,
      we give a general theorem which makes a connection between the recolourability
      of a digraph $D$ and the recolourability of its underlying graph $UG(D)$. This
      result directly extends a number of results on planar graph recolouring to planar
      digraph redicolouring.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

      "The twin-width of a graph measures its distance to co-graphs and generalizes
      classical width concepts such as tree-width or rank-width. Since its introduction
      in 2020 (Bonnet et. al. 2020), a mass of new results has appeared relating twin
      width to group theory, model theory, combinatorial optimization, and structural
      graph theory. We take a detailed look at the interplay between the twin-width
      of a graph and the twin-width of its components under tree-structured decompositions:
      We prove that the twin-width of a graph is at most twice its strong tree-width,
      contrasting nicely with the result of (Bonnet and D\\''epr\\''es 2022), which
      states that twin-width can be exponential in tree-width. Further, we employ
      the fundamental concept from structural graph theory of decomposing a graph
      into highly connected components, in order to obtain an optimal linear bound
      on the twin-width of a graph given the widths of its biconnected components.
      For triconnected components we obtain a linear upper bound if we add red edges
      to the components indicating the splits which led to the components. Extending
      this approach to quasi-4-connectivity, we obtain a quadratic upper bound. Finally,
      we investigate how the adhesion of a tree decomposition influences the twin-width
      of the decomposed graph.", "venue": "", "year": 2023, "referenceCount": 17,

      "title": "Balanced Separator Theorem for Unit Disk Graphs with Applications",
      "abstract": ". In this paper, we establish a novel balanced separator theorem
      for Unit Disk Graphs (UDGs) , which mimics the well-known Lipton and Tarjan\u2019s
      planar balanced shortest paths separator theorem. We prove that, in any n -vertex
      UDG G , one can \ufb01nd two hop-shortest paths P ( s, x ) and P ( s, y ) such
      that the removal of the 3-hop-neighborhood of these paths (i.e., N 3 G [ P (
      s, x ) \u222a P ( s, y )]) from G leaves no connected component with more than
      2 / 3 n vertices. This new balanced shortest-paths\u20143-hop-neighborhood separator
      theorem allows us to build, for any n -vertex UDG G , a system T ( G ) of at
      most 2 log 3 2 n + 2 spanning trees of G such that, for any two vertices x and
      y of G , there exists a tree T in T ( G ) with d T ( x, y ) \u2264 3 \u00b7
      d G ( x, y ) + 12. That is, the distances in any UDG can be approximately represented
      by the distances in at most 2 log 32 n + 2 of its spanning trees. Using these
      results, we propose a new compact and low delay routing labeling scheme for
      UDGs. They often model wireless ad hoc networks. We show that one can assign
      each vertex of an n -vertex UDG G a compact O (log 2 n )-bit label such that,
      given the label of a source vertex and the label of a destination, it is possible
      to compute e\ufb03ciently, based solely on these two labels, a neighbor of the
      source vertex that heads in the direction of the destination. We prove that
      this routing labeling scheme has a constant hop route-stretch (= hop delay ),
      i.e., for each two vertices x and y of G , it produces a routing path with h
      ( x, y ) hops (edges) such that h ( x, y ) \u2264 3 \u00b7 d G ( x, y ) + 12,
      where d G ( x, y ) is the hop distance between x and y in G . To the best of
      our knowledge, this is the \ufb01rst compact routing scheme for UDGs which not
      only guaranties delivery but has a low hop delay. It is easy to see that, for
      UDGs, a constant hop route-stretch implies a constant length route-stretch and
      a constant power route-stretch .", "venue": "", "year": 2008, "referenceCount":

      if the subgraph of $G$ induced by the endpoints of the edges of $M$ is a forest.
      Given a graph $G$ and a positive integer $\\ell$, Acyclic Matching asks whether

      Matching that approximates it within a constant factor when the parameter is
      the size of the matching. Our reduction is general in the sense that it also

      we are given an $n$-node, $m$-edge input graph $G$, and the goal is to compute
      a spanning subgraph $H$ on $O(n)$ edges. This can be achieved in linear $O(m
      + n)$ time via breadth-first search. But can we hope for \\emph{sublinear} runtime
      in some range of parameters? If the goal is to return $H$ as an adjacency list,
      there are simple lower bounds showing that $\\Omega(m + n)$ runtime is necessary.
      If the goal is to return $H$ as an adjacency matrix, then we need $\\Omega(n^2)$
      time just to write down the entries of the output matrix. However, we show that
      neither of these lower bounds still apply if instead the goal is to return $H$
      as an \\emph{implicit} adjacency matrix, which we call an \\emph{adjacency oracle}.
      An adjacency oracle is a data structure that gives a user the illusion that
      an adjacency matrix has been computed: it accepts edge queries $(u, v)$, and
      it returns in near-constant time a bit indicating whether $(u, v) \\in E(H)$.
      Our main result is that one can construct an adjacency oracle for a spanning
      subgraph on at most $(1+\\varepsilon)n$ edges, in $\\tilde{O}(n \\varepsilon^{-1})$
      time, and that this construction time is near-optimal. Additional results include
      constructions of adjacency oracles for $k$-connectivity certificates and spanners,
      which are similarly sublinear on dense-enough input graphs. Our adjacency oracles
      are closely related to Local Computation Algorithms (LCAs) for graph sparsifiers;
      they can be viewed as LCAs with some computation moved to a preprocessing step,
      in order to speed up queries. Our oracles imply the first Local algorithm for
      computing sparse spanning subgraphs of general input graphs in $\\tilde{O}(n)$
      query time, which works by constructing our adjacency oracle, querying it once,
      and then throwing the rest of the oracle away. This addresses an open problem

      "title": "Counting Background Knowledge Consistent Markov Equivalent Directed
      Acyclic Graphs", "abstract": "Graphs and graph unions. We mostly follow the
      graph theory terminology of Andersson et al. [1997]. A graph is undirected if
      all its edges are undirected, directed if all its edges are directed, and partially
      directed if it contains both directed and undirected edges. A directed graph
      that has no directed cycle is called a directed acyclic graph (DAG). A generalization
      of this idea is that of chain graphs: a partially directed graph is called a
      chain graph if it has no cycle which contains (i) at least one directed edge,
      and (ii) in which all directed edges are directed in the same direction as one
      moves along the cycle. We denote the neighbors of a vertex v in a graph G as
      NG(v), and an induced subgraph of G on a set X \u2286 V is denoted as G[X].
      The graph union (which we just call \u201cunion\u201d) G1 \u222aG2 includes
      vertices and edges present in any one of G1 or G2, i.e., VG1\u222aG2 = VG1 \u222aVG2
      , and EG1\u222aG2 = EG1 \u222aEG2 . The skeleton of a partially directed graph
      G is an undirected version of G which we get by ignoring the direction of all
      the edges: in particular, note that the skeleton of a partially directed graph
      is also the graph union of all the partially directed graphs with the same skeleton
      as G. A v-structure (or unshielded collider) in a partially directed graph G
      is an ordered triple of vertices (a, b, c) of G which induce the subgraph a\u2192
      b\u2190 c in G.", "venue": "Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence",

      "abstract": "We consider the Shortest Odd Path problem, where given an undirected
      graph $G$, a weight function on its edges, and two vertices $s$ and $t$ in $G$,
      the aim is to find an $(s,t)$-path with odd length and, among all such paths,
      of minimum weight. For the case when the weight function is conservative, i.e.,
      when every cycle has non-negative total weight, the complexity of the Shortest
      Odd Path problem had been open for 20 years, and was recently shown to be NP-hard.
      We give a polynomial-time algorithm for the special case when the weight function
      is conservative and the set $E^-$ of negative-weight edges forms a single tree.
      Our algorithm exploits the strong connection between Shortest Odd Path and the
      problem of finding two internally vertex-disjoint paths between two terminals
      in an undirected edge-weighted graph. It also relies on solving an intermediary
      problem variant called Shortest Parity-Constrained Odd Path where for certain
      edges we have parity constraints on their position along the path. Also, we
      exhibit two FPT algorithms for solving Shortest Odd Path in graphs with conservative
      weight functions. The first FPT algorithm is parameterized by $|E^-|$, the number
      of negative edges, or more generally, by the maximum size of a matching in the
      subgraph of $G$ spanned by $E^-$. Our second FPT algorithm is parameterized
      by the treewidth of $G$.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":
