      vertices that decreases the further away from a root node one travels, are a
      natural model for a process that weakens the further one gets from its source.
      Given an aggregation of monotone trees, one may wish to reconstruct the individual
      monotone components. A natural representation of such an aggregation would be
      a graph. While many methods have been developed for extracting hidden graph
      structure from datasets, which makes obtaining such an aggregation possible,
      decomposing such graphs into the original monotone trees is algorithmically
      challenging. Recently, a polynomial time algorithm has been developed to extract
      a minimum cardinality collection of monotone trees (M-Tree Set) from a given
      density tree - but no such algorithm exists for density graphs that may contain
      cycles. In this work, we prove that extracting such minimum M-Tree Sets of density
      graphs is NP-Complete. We additionally prove three additional variations of
      the problem - such as the minimum M-Tree Set such that the intersection between
      any two monotone trees is either empty or contractible (SM-Tree Set) - are also
      NP-Complete. We conclude by providing some approximation algorithms, highlighted

      "title": "On the Parameterized Complexity of Multiway Near-Separator", "abstract":
      "We study a new graph separation problem called Multiway Near-Separator. Given
      an undirected graph $G$, integer $k$, and terminal set $T \\subseteq V(G)$,
      it asks whether there is a vertex set $S \\subseteq V(G) \\setminus T$ of size
      at most $k$ such that in graph $G-S$, no pair of distinct terminals can be connected
      by two pairwise internally vertex-disjoint paths. Hence each terminal pair can
      be separated in $G-S$ by removing at most one vertex. The problem is therefore
      a generalization of (Node) Multiway Cut, which asks for a vertex set for which
      each terminal is in a different component of $G-S$. We develop a fixed-parameter
      tractable algorithm for Multiway Near-Separator running in time $2^{O(k \\log
      k)} * n^{O(1)}$. Our algorithm is based on a new pushing lemma for solutions
      with respect to important separators, along with two problem-specific ingredients.
      The first is a polynomial-time subroutine to reduce the number of terminals
      in the instance to a polynomial in the solution size $k$ plus the size of a
      given suboptimal solution. The second is a polynomial-time algorithm that, given
      a graph $G$ and terminal set $T \\subseteq V(G)$ along with a single vertex
      $x \\in V(G)$ that forms a multiway near-separator, computes a 14-approximation
      for the problem of finding a multiway near-separator not containing $x$.", "venue":

      dominating set is a graph problem that asks for the smallest subset of vertices

      The second rule allows for propagation of the observation status to vertices

      "This paper aims at finding node-disjoint paths in multi-domain networks while
      avoiding to disclose each domain topology and minimizing routing cost. In order
      to maintain the privacy of the domains, the proposed solutions exploit a full
      mesh Topology Aggregation scheme that limits the exchanged information. Each
      domain provides information only on the existence and total cost of the two
      shortest node-disjoint paths for every pair of aggregated links. This information
      is then utilized on the inter-domain aggregated topology for the computation
      of two node-disjoint paths with minimum cost for every demand in the network.
      Four approaches are proposed and evaluated in terms of average cost per demand
      and blocking probability. Their performance is also compared to the respective
      approaches for link-disjoint routing. Two of the proposed node-disjoint routing

      G, Z(G), is the smallest cardinality of any set S of vertices on which repeated
      applications of the forcing rule results in all vertices being included in S.
      The forcing rule is as follows: if a vertex v is in S, and exactly one neighbor
      u of v is not in S, then u is added to S in the next iteration. The failed zero
      forcing number of a graph was introduced by Fetcie, Jacob, and Saavedra and
      was defined as the cardinality of the largest set of vertices which fails to
      force all vertices in the graph. In 2021, Gomez et al. proved that there were
      exactly 15 graphs with a failed zero forcing number of two, but their proof

      "title": "Packing Lower Bounds for Cluster Editing", "abstract": "Cluster Editing
      is the problem of finding a minimal set of edge modifications to transform a
      given graph into a cluster graph - a graph whose connected components are cliques.
      A set of induced, vertex pair disjoint paths of length two in the given graph
      is a lower bound for the number of required edge modifications. To find such
      sets, we define and examine a type of intersection graph, the P 3 - intersection
      graph , that models which induced paths of length two, called P 3 s, in a given
      graph share a vertex pair. Now, any independent set on the P 3 -intersection
      graph yields a lower bound for the Cluster Editing problem on the given graph.
      Unfortunately, Maximum Independent Set generally is NP-hard. However, the complexity
      on P 3 -intersection graphs is unknown. In this work, we show that the neighbourhood
      of every vertex in a P 3 -intersection graph can be partitioned into three cliques
      characterized by which vertex pair the contained vertices share with the respective
      vertex. We also prove that edges between these cliques strictly follow a specific
      structure. Additionally, we briefly discuss possible approaches to show the
      NP-hardness of Maximum Independent Set on P 3 -intersection graphs. Finally,
      we transfer the concept of P 3 -intersection graphs to stars and paths of arbitrary
      length. We find that it is infeasible to compute a maximum independent set on
      these types of intersection graphs.", "venue": "", "year": null, "referenceCount":

      formalizing cluster identification in graphs. In other words we ask whether
      a graph contains a large enough and sufficiently connected subgraph. We study
      here three relaxations of Clique : s - Club and s - Clique , in which the relaxation
      is focused on the distances in respectively the cluster and the original graph,
      and \u03b3 - Complete Subgraph in which the relaxation is made on the minimal
      degree in the cluster. As these three problems are known to be NP -hard, we
      study here their parameterized complexities. We prove that s - Club and s -
      Clique are NP -hard even restricted to graphs of degeneracy \u2264 3 whenever
      s \u2265 3 , and to graphs of degeneracy \u2264 2 whenever s \u2265 5 , which
      is a strictly stronger result than its W[1] -hardness parameterized by the degeneracy.
      Concerning \u03b3 - Complete Subgraph , we prove that it is W [1]-hard parameterized
      both by the degeneracy, implying the W[1] -hardness parameterized by the number

      there always exists a flip sequence of length at most $2n-4$ between any pair
      of non-crossing spanning trees (where $n$ denotes the number of points). Hernando
      et al. proved that the length of a minimal flip sequence can be of length at

      "title": "Distributed Deterministic Exact Minimum Weight Cycle and Multi Source
      Shortest Paths in Near Linear Rounds in CONGEST model", "abstract": "We present
      new deterministic algorithms for computing distributed weighted minimum weight
      cycle (MWC) in undirected and directed graphs and distributed weighted all nodes
      shortest cycle (ANSC) in directed graphs. Our algorithms for these problems
      run in $\\tilde{O}(n)$ rounds in the CONGEST model on graphs with arbitrary
      non-negative edge weights, matching the lower bound up to polylogarithmic factors.
      Before our work, no near linear rounds deterministic algorithms were known for
      these problems. The previous best bound for solving these problems deterministically
      requires an initial computation of all pairs shortest paths (APSP) on the given
      graph, followed by post-processing of $O(n)$ rounds, and in total takes $\\tilde{O}(n^{4/3})$
      rounds, using deterministic APSP~\\cite{AR-SPAA20}. The main component of our
      new $\\tilde{O}(n)$ rounds algorithms is a deterministic technique for constructing
      a sequence of successive blocker sets. These blocker sets are then treated as
      source nodes to compute $h$-hop shortest paths, which can then be used to compute
      candidate shortest cycles whose hop length lies in a particular range. The shortest
      cycles can then be obtained by selecting the cycle with the minimum weight from
      all these candidate cycles. Additionally using the above blocker set sequence
      technique, we also obtain $\\tilde{O}(n)$ rounds deterministic algorithm for
      the multi-source shortest paths problem (MSSP) for both directed and undirected
      graphs, given that the size of the source set is at most $\\sqrt{n}$. This new
      result for MSSP can be a step towards obtaining a $o(n^{4/3})$ rounds algorithm
      for deterministic APSP. We also believe that our new blocker set sequence technique
      may have potential applications for other distributed algorithms.", "venue":

      of U. We consider the problems of partitioning U into k sets from F, covering
      U with k sets from F, and packing k non-intersecting sets from F into U. Classically,
      these problems can be solved via inclusion-exclusion in O*(2^n) time [BjorklundHK09].
      Quantumly, there are faster algorithms for graph coloring with running time
      O(1.9140^n) [ShimizuM22] and for Set Cover with a small number of sets with
      running time O(1.7274^n |F|^O(1)) [AmbainisBIKPV19]. In this paper, we give
      a quantum speedup for Set Partition, Set Cover, and Set Packing whenever there
      is a classical enumeration algorithm that lends itself to a quadratic quantum
      speedup, which, for any subinstance on a subset X of U, enumerates at least

      and Steingrimsson introduced the concept of weight to these trees and proved
      a bijection between maximum weight maxmin trees and permutations, defining weights
      for permutations. In addition, the q-Eulerian polynomial $E_n(x, q)$ is defined
      which relates descents and weights of permutations. This polynomial was later
      proven to exhibit a stabilization phenomenon by Agrawal et al. Extracting the
      formal power series $W_d(t)$ from the stabilization of these coefficients, $W_d(t)$
      was conjectured to partially correspond to A256193. In our paper, we introduce
      a process called minimum decomposition to help us better understand maxmin trees.

      "title": "Locally Checkable Labeling Problems in Rooted Trees in the Online-LOCAL
      Model of Computation", "abstract": "There are many ways to classify algorithms.
      Online algorithms, for example, are algorithms that have to be able to handle
      input one element at a time. Offline algorithms, on the other hand, have access
      to the whole input. In the case of online graph algorithms, the structure of
      the underlying graph is fixed. The graph is revealed to the algorithm one node
      at a time. When a node is revealed, the algorithm has to decide its output for
      that node, and it cannot change its decision later. Another way to classify
      algorithms is to divide them into centralized and distributed algorithms. In
      the case of graph algorithms, a centralized algorithm is a completely separate
      entity from the graph. When the nodes (or edges) of the graph are active parties
      in the execution of the algorithm, the algorithm is called a distributed algorithm.
      One commonly used model of distributed computation is the LOCAL model. In the
      LOCAL model, all nodes are computing their own part of the result in parallel.
      The nodes only see their own local neighborhood and need to base their decision
      only on this local view. In this thesis, I introduce the online-LOCAL model,
      which combines the power of online graph algorithms and LOCAL algorithms. Like
      online graph algorithms, online-LOCAL algorithms need to react to nodes being
      revealed one at a time. Unlike online graph algorithms, online-LOCAL algorithms
      also get to see the local neighborhood around the nodes before needing to make
      their decisions. The online-LOCAL model is a very strong model of computation.
      In general, there are problems that are trivial in the online-LOCAL model, but
      difficult to solve with online graph algorithms and LOCAL algorithms. In this
      thesis, I restrict my attention to the class of problems known as locally checkable
      labeling problems. These are a broad class of problems for which a solution
      is valid if it looks valid in all local neighborhoods. In particular, I show
      that for locally checkable labeling problems in rooted regular trees, the online-LOCAL
      model is approximately as powerful as the LOCAL model.", "venue": "", "year":

      regime Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi (ER) networks consist of finite tree components,
      which are nonextensive in the network size. The distribution of shortest path
      lengths (DSPL) of subcritical ER networks was recently calculated using a topological
      expansion [E. Katzav, O. Biham, and A. K. Hartmann, Phys. Rev. E 98, 012301
      (2018)2470-004510.1103/PhysRevE.98.012301]. The DSPL, which accounts for the
      distance \u2113 between any pair of nodes that reside on the same finite tree
      component, was found to follow a geometric distribution of the form P(L=\u2113|L<\u221e)=(1-c)c^{\u2113-1},
      where 0<c<1 is the mean degree of the network. This result includes the contributions
      of trees of all possible sizes and topologies. Here we calculate the distribution
      of shortest path lengths P(L=\u2113|S=s) between random pairs of nodes that
      reside on the same tree component of a given size s. It is found that P(L=\u2113|S=s)=\u2113+1/s^{\u2113}(s-2)!/(s-\u2113-1)!.
      Surprisingly, this distribution does not depend on the mean degree c of the
      network from which the tree components were extracted. This is due to the fact
      that the ensemble of tree components of a given size s in subcritical ER networks
      is sampled uniformly from the set of labeled trees of size s and thus does not
      depend on c. The moments of the DSPL are also calculated. It is found that the
      mean distance between random pairs of nodes on tree components of size s satisfies
      E[L|S=s]\u223csqrt[s], unlike small-world networks in which the mean distance
      scales logarithmically with s.", "venue": "Physical Review E", "year": 2023,

      Networks", "abstract": "Mesh, hypercube, HHN, bubbls-sort, star, transposition,
      and macro-star graphs have been proposed as interconnection networks used in
      high-performance parallel computer structures. A hypercube expresses a node
      with n binary numbers, and has an edge between 1-bit other nodes. A hypercube
      is an excellent network from a graph-theoretic point of view, such as node symmetry,
      fault tolerance, recursive scalability, and Hamiltonian cycles. However, compared
      to the increase in the number of nodes, the number of edges increases proportionally,
      so the network cost is not good. The HHN graph was proposed as a network that
      improved the network cost by improving the disadvantages of the hypercube. HHN
      graph uses hypercube as a basic module. The HHN graph is a network that has
      improved network cost by designing it to have a hierarchical structure based
      on a hypercube. HHN graphs have a simple routing algorithm with fewer branches
      and fewer links than hypercubes. Although HHN''s routing algorithm has a simple
      advantage, it has a disadvantage that the path length is long via unnecessary
      nodes. In this study, we propose a new routing algorithm that improves the path
      length of the HHN graph and analyze its efficiency. The improved routing algorithm
      proposed in this study has the result of improving the existing algorithm by
      30% on average. In addition, we analyze the embedding of one interconnection

      paper, an algorithm is presented, solving the 3-SAT problem in a polynomial
      runtime of O ( n 3 ) , which implies P = NP . This would solve the P/NP problem.
      The 3-SAT problem is about determining, whether or not a logical expression,
      consisting of clauses with up to 3 literals connected by OR-expressions, that
      are interconnected by AND-expressions, is satis\ufb01able. For the solution
      a new data structure, the 3-SAT graph, is introduced. It groups the clauses
      from a 3-SAT expression into coalitions, that contain all clauses with literals
      consisting of the same variables. The nodes of the graph represent the variables
      connecting the corresponding coalitions. An algorithm R will be introduced,
      that identi\ufb01es relations between clauses by transmitting markers, called
      upgrades , through the graph, making use of implications. The algorithm will
      start sequentially for every variable and create start upgrades, one for the
      variables negated and one for its non-negated literals. It will be shown, that
      the start upgrades have to be within a speci\ufb01c clause pattern, called edge
      pattern , to mark a beginning or ending of an unsatis\ufb01able sequence. The
      algorithm will eventually identify other kinds of pattern within the upgraded
      clauses. Depending on the pattern, the algorithm either sends the upgrades on
      through the graph, creates new following upgrades to extend the upgrade path
      , a subgraph storing all previous upgrades, or if all connector literals of
      a pattern have received upgrades of the same path or two corresponding following
      upgrades circle, marks the upgrade as circling . If an upgrade circles , then
      it is unsatis\ufb01able on its path. It will be proven, that if after several
      execution steps of algorithm R , two corresponding start upgrades circle, then
      the expression is unsatis\ufb01able and if no upgrade steps are possible anymore
      and the algorithm did not return unsatis\ufb01able, the expression is satis\ufb01able.

      Set of Objects problem, we are given an $n$-vertex planar graph $G$ and a family

      number of pairwise disjoint polygons in a given family of polygons in the plane.

      design a meta-algorithm that solves all these problems and whose running time

      Our meta-algorithm simpli\ufb01es and uni\ufb01es the known algorithms for each
      of the parameters and its running time matches asymptotically also the running
      times of the best known algorithms for basic NP -hard problems such as Vertex

      highlight the importance of this equivalence relation on the algorithmic applications

      "title": "Modi\ufb01ed and Improved Algorithm for Finding a Median Path with
      a Speci\ufb01c Length ( (cid:96) ) for a Tree Network", "abstract": ": The median
      path problem (min-sum criterion) is a common problem in graph theory and tree
      networks. This problem is open to study because its applications are growing
      and extending in different \ufb01elds, such as providing insight for decision-makers
      when selecting the optimal location for non-emergency services, including railroad
      lines, highways, pipelines, and transit routes. Also, the min-sum criterion
      can deal with several networks in different applications. The location problem
      has traditionally been concerned with the optimal location of a single-point
      facility at either a vertex or along an edge in a network. Recently, numerous
      investigators have investigated this classic problem and have studied the location
      of many facilities, such as paths, trees, and cycles. The concept of the median,
      which measures the centrality of a vertex in a graph, is extended to the paths
      in a graph. In this paper, we consider the problem of locating path-shaped facilities
      on a tree network. A new modi\ufb01ed and improved algorithm for \ufb01nding
      a median single path facility of a speci\ufb01ed length in a tree network is
      proposed. The median criterion for optimality considers the sum of the distances
      from all vertices of the tree to the path facility. This problem under the median
      criterion is called the (cid:96) -core problem. The distance between any two
      vertices in the tree is equal to the length of the unique path connecting them.
      This location problem usually has applications in distributed database systems,
      pipelines, the design of public transportation routes, and communication networks.",

      "In this paper, we study the problem of finding a minimum weight spanning tree
      that contains each vertex in a given subset $V_{\\rm NT}$ of vertices as an
      internal vertex. This problem, called Minimum Weight Non-Terminal Spanning Tree,
      includes $s$-$t$ Hamiltonian Path as a special case, and hence it is NP-hard.
      In this paper, we first observe that Non-Terminal Spanning Tree, the unweighted
      counterpart of Minimum Weight Non-Terminal Spanning Tree, is already NP-hard
      on some special graph classes. Moreover, it is W[1]-hard when parameterized
      by clique-width. In contrast, we give a $3k$-vertex kernel and $O^*(2^k)$-time
      algorithm, where $k$ is the size of non-terminal set $V_{\\rm NT}$. The latter
      algorithm can be extended to Minimum Weight Non-Terminal Spanning Tree with
      the restriction that each edge has a polynomially bounded integral weight. We
      also show that Minimum Weight Non-Terminal Spanning Tree is fixed-parameter
      tractable parameterized by the number of edges in the subgraph induced by the
      non-terminal set $V_{\\rm NT}$, extending the fixed-parameter tractability of
      Minimum Weight Non-Terminal Spanning Tree to the general case. Finally, we give

      "title": "Enumerating minimal solution sets for metric graph problems", "abstract":
      "Problems from metric graph theory such as Metric Dimension, Geodetic Set, and
      Strong Metric Dimension have recently had a strong impact on the field of parameterized
      complexity by being the first problems in NP to admit double-exponential lower
      bounds in the treewidth, and even in the vertex cover number for the latter.
      We initiate the study of enumerating minimal solution sets for these problems
      and show that they are also of great interest in enumeration. More specifically,
      we show that enumerating minimal resolving sets in graphs and minimal geodetic
      sets in split graphs are equivalent to hypergraph dualization, arguably one
      of the most important open problems in algorithmic enumeration. This provides
      two new natural examples to a question that emerged in different works this
      last decade: for which vertex (or edge) set graph property $\\Pi$ is the enumeration
      of minimal (or maximal) subsets satisfying $\\Pi$ equivalent to hypergraph dualization?
      As only very few properties are known to fit within this context -- namely,
      properties related to minimal domination -- our results make significant progress
      in characterizing such properties, and provide new angles of approach for tackling
      hypergraph dualization. In a second step, we consider cases where our reductions
      do not apply, namely graphs with no long induced paths, and show these cases
      to be mainly tractable.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

      "title": "Simpler and Higher Lower Bounds for Shortcut Sets", "abstract": "We
      provide a variety of lower bounds for the well-known shortcut set problem: how
      much can one decrease the diameter of a directed graph on $n$ vertices and $m$
      edges by adding $O(n)$ or $O(m)$ of shortcuts from the transitive closure of
      the graph. Our results are based on a vast simplification of the recent construction
      of Bodwin and Hoppenworth [FOCS 2023] which was used to show an $\\widetilde{\\Omega}(n^{1/4})$
      lower bound for the $O(n)$-sized shortcut set problem. We highlight that our
      simplification completely removes the use of the convex sets by B\\''ar\\''any
      and Larman [Math. Ann. 1998] used in all previous lower bound constructions.
      Our simplification also removes the need for randomness and further removes
      some log factors. This allows us to generalize the construction to higher dimensions,
      which in turn can be used to show the following results. For $O(m)$-sized shortcut
      sets, we show an $\\Omega(n^{1/5})$ lower bound, improving on the previous best
      $\\Omega(n^{1/8})$ lower bound. For all $\\varepsilon>0$, we show that there
      exists a $\\delta>0$ such that there are $n$-vertex $O(n)$-edge graphs $G$ where
      adding any shortcut set of size $O(n^{2-\\varepsilon})$ keeps the diameter of
      $G$ at $\\Omega(n^\\delta)$. This improves the sparsity of the constructed graph
      compared to a known similar result by Hesse [SODA 2003]. We also consider the
      sourcewise setting for shortcut sets: given a graph $G=(V,E)$, a set $S\\subseteq
      V$, how much can we decrease the sourcewise diameter of $G$, $\\max_{(s, v)
      \\in S \\times V, \\text{dist}(s, v)<\\infty} \\text{dist}(s,v)$ by adding a
      set of edges $H$ from the transitive closure of $G$? We show that for any integer
      $d \\ge 2$, there exists a graph $G=(V, E)$ on $n$ vertices and $S \\subseteq
      V$ with $|S| = \\widetilde{\\Theta}(n^{3/(d+3)})$, such that when adding $O(n)$
      or $O(m)$ shortcuts, the sourcewise diameter is $\\widetilde{\\Omega}(|S|^{1/3})$.",

      this chapter we focus on the case of k = 3. As a first example, it is easy to
      notice that in any subset A \u2282 {1, . . . , n} with |A| \u2265 \u23082n/3\u2309
      there exists a 3-term arithmetic progression in A. Indeed, partition {1, . .
      . , n} into triples of consecutive numbers (1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), and so on (possibly
      with one or two elements without a triple at the end), and notice that a set
      without a 3-term arithmetic progression can have at most two elements out of
      each triple. In Section 5 we prove that every set A \u2282 {1, . . . , n} with
      |A| \u2265 cn lg lgn (for some constant c) contains a 3-term arithmetic progression.
      This result is known as Roth\u2019s theorem and is one of the two theorem for
      which Roth received his fields medal. Before that, in Section 4 we consider
      a somewhat simpler variant of the problem in F3 . After observing Theorem 1.1,
      one natural question that arises is: What happens when |A| is of a smaller density?
      The following theorem shows that the theorem is false for a somewhat smaller

      of the Giudici-Green Metropolis sampling method for decomposable graphs using
      a variety of structures to represent the graph. These comprise the graph itself,
      the Junction tree, the Almond tree and the Ibarra clique-separator graph. For

      a specific edge results in a new graph that is also decomposable, and the updates
      that need to be made to the structure if the edge perturbation is made. For
      the Almond tree and Ibarra graph these procedures are novel. We find that using
      the graph itself is generally at least competitive in terms of computational
      efficiency for a variety of graph distributions, but note that the other structures
      may allow and suggest samplers using different perturbations with lower rejection
      rates and/or better mixing properties. The sampler has applications in estimating

      "title": "Separator Theorem and Algorithms for Planar Hyperbolic Graphs", "abstract":
      "The hyperbolicity of a graph, informally, measures how close a graph is (metrically)
      to a tree. Hence, it is intuitively similar to treewidth, but the measures are
      formally incomparable. Motivated by the broad study of algorithms and separators
      on planar graphs and their relation to treewidth, we initiate the study of planar
      graphs of bounded hyperbolicity. Our main technical contribution is a novel
      balanced separator theorem for planar $\\delta$-hyperbolic graphs that is substantially
      stronger than the classic planar separator theorem. For any fixed $\\delta \\geq
      0$, we can find balanced separator that induces either a single geodesic (shortest)
      path or a single geodesic cycle in the graph. An important advantage of our
      separator is that the union of our separator (vertex set $Z$) with any subset
      of the connected components of $G - Z$ induces again a planar $\\delta$-hyperbolic
      graph, which would not be guaranteed with an arbitrary separator. Our construction
      runs in near-linear time and guarantees that size of separator is $\\mathrm{poly}(\\delta)
      \\cdot \\log n$. As an application of our separator theorem and its strong properties,
      we obtain two novel approximation schemes on planar $\\delta$-hyperbolic graphs.
      We prove that Maximum Independent Set and the Traveling Salesperson problem
      have a near-linear time FPTAS for any constant $\\delta$, running in $n\\, \\mathrm{polylog}(n)
      \\cdot 2^{\\mathcal{O}(\\delta^2)} \\cdot \\varepsilon^{-\\mathcal{O}(\\delta)}$
      time. We also show that our approximation scheme for Maximum Independent Set
      has essentially the best possible running time under the Exponential Time Hypothesis
      (ETH). This immediately follows from our third contribution: we prove that Maximum
      Independent Set has no $n^{o(\\delta)}$-time algorithm on planar $\\delta$-hyperbolic
      graphs, unless ETH fails.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":
