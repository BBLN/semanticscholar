        "title": "Dystopian or Utopian? Two Images of Alan Turing", "abstract": "Turing
        made intriguing statements about the future of arti\ufb01cial intelligence
        (AI) in society. He predicted that machines would eventually \u2018compete
        with men in all purely intellectual \ufb01elds,\u2019 and added that at some
        stage they could be expected \u2018to take control.\u2019 Turing has been
        associated by his biographer, Andrew Hodges, with Dr. Frankenstein from Mary
        Shelley\u2019s dystopian novel. However, he has also been described by his
        contemporary Geoffrey Jefferson as a \u2018scienti\ufb01c\u2019 Percy B. Shelley,
        the English Romantic poet who was posthumously championed as a utopian and
        radical thinker. This article then asks: in what way did Turing envision a
        society permeated with intelligent machines? Did he see it as a utopia or
        a dystopia? These questions are thoroughly examined using Turing\u2019s own
        texts and related sources. This study reconstructs Turing\u2019s historical
        context in postwar England and analyzes his irony and sense of humor, as well
        as the in\ufb02uence of Samuel Butler on his vision. Contrary to recent views
        in AI science and \ufb01ction, on the one hand, a mismatch is shown between
        Turing and the incautious Frankenstein; on the other hand, Turing\u2019s radical
        Shelley-like qualities are substantiated. The article shows that Turing\u2019s
        utopianism entrusted intelligent machines with the task of teaching lessons
        of rationality and intellectual integrity over our place in nature and prejudices.
        Further, Turing\u2019s irony is shown to have targeted intellectuals who sacri\ufb01ce
        independent thinking to retain their power. These, he hoped, would be eventually
        rivaled and surpassed by intelligent machines.", "venue": "", "year": 2022,

        "2012 was the Alan Turing Year \u2014 the celebration of the 100th anniversary
        of Alan Turing\u2019s birth. Turing\u2019s biographer Andrew Hodges in the
        \u201cForward\u201d to The Turing Guide comments that \u201cTuring\u2019s
        centenary year reflected a general public sense that the issues of Alan Turing\u2019s
        life and work are as relevant as ever in the twentyfirst century.\u201d The
        Turing Guide consists of 42 essays that are written for general readers and
        that celebrate Turing\u2019s: life (38 pages), accomplishments in mathematics
        (44 pages), codebreaking (120 pages), On Computable Numbers and the Turing
        machine (36 pages), postwar work on computers (67 pages), contributions to
        morphogenesis (32 pages), ideas related to machine intelligence (86 pages),
        and legacy (32 pages). Eleven essays deal directly with codebreaking. Copeland
        either wrote, participated in the writing of, or revised 16 of the essays.
        Of the eight essays in the section \u201cArtificial Intelligence and the Mind,\u201d
        three were written by Diane Proudfoot and one includes her as a coauthor with
        Copeland (who wrote one other essay and coauthored a third essay in that section).
        The book begins with an overview of Turing\u2019s life and work by Copeland
        and Bowen. The essay is mostly a timeline of Turing\u2019s life. The authors
        suggest that Turing\u2019s death might have been accidental. Chapter 3, \u201cMeeting
        a Genius\u201d (4 pages), is by mathematician and Bletchley Park codebreaker
        Peter Hilton (1923\u20132010). Notes to the chapter (p. 485) state that the
        chapter was \u201cassembled by Jack Copeland\u201d and \u201cpublished with
        the permission of [Hilton\u2019s] wife.\u201d It is also noted that \u201c[in]
        2001 and again in 2002 [Hilton] visited Copeland at the University of Canterbury
        in New Zealand, where he delivered lectures on Turing and codebreaking. [The]
        chapter is a compilation of extracts from [Hilton\u2019s] papers and notes
        left in New Zealand, together with extracts from [Hilton\u2019s]", "venue":

        "title": "Alan Turing", "abstract": "When the name \u201dAlan Turing\u201d
        is mentioned most people think of one or more of the following words: \u201dTuring
        Machine\u201d, \u201dTuring Test\u201d, \u201dEnigma\u201d and \u201dArtificial
        Intelligence\u201d. The intention of this article is to present a broader
        approach to Alan Turing instead of solely focusing on the above mentioned
        key words. Alan Turing was not only a key figure in computer science and crypto-analysis.
        His work also revolved around subjects such as the growth of plants, the human
        mind and he also anticipated many of the issues that are being discussed in
        today\u2019s artificial intelligence research. Being unconventional, ahead
        of his time as a visionary and openly admitting his homosexuality caused a
        lot personal problems during his life. However Alan Turing was successfully
        able to balance his life by relying on personal friends, scientific colleagues,
        his work and sports. He became a tragic icon when he died at age 42 apparently
        having committed suicide. 1 Family background and childhood: Alan Mathison
        Turing was born in London on 23 June 1912. His parents Julius Mathison and
        Ethel Sara Turing had met in India where Julius worked in the Indian Civil
        Service. Ethel Sara was the daughter of a chief engineer working for Madras
        railways. Alan also had an older brother named John. The two boys spent most
        of their childhood with a variety of foster parents as Julius and Ethel soon
        moved back to India after Alan\u2019s birth. His childhood was mainly influenced
        by his family situation and his family\u2019s upper-middle-class status inside
        the English society at the beginning of the 20th century. There was little
        incentive for scientific exploration in the family or school at the time so
        Alan\u2019s first contact with science occurred during his free time. One
        of the books which he read during his childhood was called \u201dNatural Wonders

        network model for a mechanism of visual pattern recognition is proposed in
        this paper. The network is self-organized by \"learning without a teacher\",
        and acquires an ability to recognize stimulus patterns based on the geometrical
        similarity (Gestalt) of their shapes without affected by their positions.
        This network is given a nickname \"neocognitron\". After completion of self-organization,
        the network has a structure similar to the hierarchy model of the visual nervous
        system proposed by Hubel and Wiesel. The network consists of an input layer
        (photoreceptor array) followed by a cascade connection of a number of modular
        structures, each of which is composed of two layers of cells connected in
        a cascade. The first layer of each module consists of \"S-cells'', which show
        characteristics similar to simple cells or lower order hypercomplex cells,
        and the second layer consists of \"C-cells\" similar to complex cells or higher
        order hypercomplex cells. The afferent synapses to each S-cell have plasticity
        and are modifiable. The network has an ability of unsupervised learning: We
        do not need any \"teacher\" during the process of selforganization, and it
        is only needed to present a set of stimulus patterns repeatedly to the input
        layer of the network. The network has been simulated on a digital computer.
        After repetitive presentation of a set of stimulus patterns, each stimulus
        pattern has become to elicit an output only from one of the C-cells of the
        last layer, and conversely, this C-cell has become selectively responsive
        only to that stimulus pattern. That is, none of the C-cells of the last layer
        responds to more than one stimulus pattern. The response of the C-cells of
        the last layer is not affected by the pattern''s position at all. Neither
        is it affected by a small change in shape nor in size of the stimulus pattern.",

        \u2014 Alan Turing Centenary Special Issue", "abstract": "Preface We can only
        see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be done.
        Year 2012 is both the centenary of Alan Turing''s birth and the 60th anniversary
        of the famous paper The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis, in which he established
        foundations of the mathematical theory of biological and chemical pattern
        formation. The story started much earlier, in spring 1923, as documented by
        his mother in a caricature entitled Hockey or Watching the Daisies Grow. Crucial
        motif in the drawing is that, while most players are engaged by the game,
        Alan is investigating a flower emerging just off the field. Always fascinated
        by the relationship between matter and spirit, especially in the processes
        of thinking , Turing started from the assumption that the operation of human
        brain is completely physical. This led him to invention of an abstract computing
        machine named after him, which laid the foundations of modern computer science.
        In recognition of his enormous contribution to the growth of the field, the
        most prestigious award in computer science, called \" Nobel Prize of computing
        \" , is named after Turing. Success has many fathers, but it was Alan Turing
        to whom we owe the final breaking of the Enigma code. He extended the idea
        of so-called \" Cryptology bombs \" , i.e., machines aimed at breaking codes,
        constructed before World War II by Polish mathematicians: Rejewski, R\u00f3\u02d9
        zycki and Zygalski. His solution ensured the information advantage of the
        Allies during the Battle of the Atlantic, which had a direct bearing on the
        success of operations in Normandy and the defeat of Nazi Germany. After the
        war, Turing took up marathon running to relieve the stress, studied why spots
        on the leop-ard''s body are in the shape of a rosette or ring, and proposed
        a test to measure the machine''s ability to exhibit intelligent behavior.
        For this last reason, Turing is regarded as a founder of artificial intelligence.
        He left this world prematurely in the age of 42, but managed to finish the
        race with the highest score, in fact more than one race.. . In this special
        issue, we present a selection of papers commemorating Alan Turing and arguing
        that he should be also considered the co-founder of biomathematics and bioinformatics.

        domain for computer science research, having the nice characteristics of a
        clearly deened set of rules and a speciic goal. Developing a program to play
        a strategic game well often involves the application of theoretical concepts
        to practical situations, and the relative success of that endeavour can be
        measured with quantiiable results. The game of poker is logistically simple
        yet strategically complex, and ooers many properties not exhibited by chess,
        checkers, and most other well-studied games. Most importantly, poker is a
        non-deterministic game with imperfect (hidden) information. Handling unreliable
        or incomplete information is a fundamental problem in computer science, and
        poker provides an excellent domain for investigating problems of decision
        making under conditions of uncertainty. Somewhat surprisingly, the potential
        beneets of studying poker have been largely overlooked by computer scientists
        and game researchers. In this essay we survey what resources are available

        "title": "Artificial Intelligence : Usfssg Computers to Think about Thinking
        . Part 1", "abstract": "In 1950, Alan M. Turing, the late deputy director
        of the University of Manchester\u2019s Computing Laboratory in England, proposed
        a novel test to determine whether a machine was capable of thinking. In thk
        test, an interrogator has a teletype conversation with a man and a woman,
        both of whom must try to convince the interrogator that they are the woman.
        At some point unknown to the interrogator, the man is replaced by a machine.
        If the interrogator is fooled as often by the machine as by the man, that
        machine can be said to have displayed intelligent behavior. 1 Some 30 years
        after Turing proposed this test, many aspects of human behavior have been
        simulated by a computer. Programs have been designed to play checkersz and
        chess,J prove mathematical theorems ,4,5 and even mimic the behavior of a
        paranoid human being.b Despite the success of these and many other programs,
        none of the researchers investigating what\u2019s been variously cafled \u201capplied
        epistemology\u201d or \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d (AI) would claim
        this means the \u201cthinking machine\u201d has arrived. Instead, they would
        agree that these programs have contributed important information about human
        behavior, and how computers can simulate it. The first part of this two-part
        essay will review some of the theones AI researchers have developed to explain
        human \u201cinformation processing.\u201d The second part of the essay will
        cover some applications of AI research. These include programs used in robotics,
        programs that communicate with computer users in natural languages such as
        English, and \u201cexpert systems\u201d which help chemists, physicians, and
        others perform decision-making tasks. The \u201cpioneer\u201d expert system,
        DENDRAL, will be discussed in some detail.T.~ AI grew out of the convergence
        of ideas in several different fields, and the availability of new technologies.
        According to Avrom Barr and Edward A. Feigenbaum, Stanford University, California,
        the single most important factor contributing to the birth of the field was
        the invention of the computer.9 They point out that human beings have always
        drawn analogies between mechanical devices and their own behavior. Computers,
        with their memories and information-processing abilities, naturafly invited
        analogies with the human brain. Shortly after digital computers became available,
        computer scientists began creating programs that, they hoped, would perform
        tasks generally considered to require intelligence. Their earliest efforts
        were directed at programming computers to solve puzzles, play games such as
        chess, backgammon, and checkers, solve mathematical theorems, and translate
        text from one language to another. The early computer programs performed these
        tasks, but not very well. For example, chess programs were successful at following
        the step-by-step instructions for moving chessmen. But computers couldn\u2019t

        a definition I shall replace the question by another, which is closely related
        to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words. The new form of the
        problem can be described in terms of a game which we call the ''imitation
        game''. It is played with three people, a man (A), a woman (B), and an interrogator
        (C) who may be of either sex. The interrogator stays in a room apart from
        the other two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine
        which of the other two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by
        labels X and Y, and at the end of the game he says either '' X is A and Y
        is B '' or '' X is B and Y is A''. The interrogator is allowed to put questions
        to A and B thus: C: Will X please tell me the length of his or her hair 2

        logical system, if its use is to be carried beyond a rather elementary stage,
        needs powerful conventions about abbreviations: in particular one usually
        wants to modify the bracketing so as to make the formulae more readable, and
        also possibly shorter. The present note has been written in the belief that
        Church''s formulation of the simple theory of types is particularly suitable
        as a basis for work on that theory, and that it is therefore worth while introducing
        special conventions which take into account the needs of this particular system.
        The conventions which I shall describe are ones which I have used a good deal
        myself, and have always found adequate. I intend to make use of them in forthcoming
        papers. They may be regarded as an extension of Curry''s conventions. I shall
        begin with a general discussion of punctuation by means of groups of dots.
        This general theory is applicable, with some modifications, to Russell''s,
        Quine''s, and Curry''s bracketing systems as well as to the present one.",

        have been given to express an exact meaning corresponding to the intuitive
        idea of \u2018effective calculability\u2019 as applied for instance to functions
        of positive integers. The purpose of the present paper is to show that the
        computable functions introduced by the author are identical with the \u03bb-definable
        functions of Church and the general recursive functions due to Herbrand and
        G\u00f6del and developed by Kleene. It is shown that every \u03bb-definable
        function is computable and that every computable function is general recursive.
        There is a modified form of \u03bb-definability, known as \u03bb-K-definability,
        and it turns out to be natural to put the proof that every \u03bb-definable
        function is computable in the form of a proof that every \u03bb-K-definable
        function is computable; that every \u03bb-definable function is \u03bb-K-definable
        is trivial. If these results are taken in conjunction with an already available
        proof that every general recursive function is \u03bb-definable we shall have
        the required equivalence of computability with \u03bb-definability and incidentally
        a new proof of the equivalence of \u03bb-definability and \u03bb-K-definability.
        A definition of what is meant by a computable function cannot be given satisfactorily
        in a short space. I therefore refer the reader to Computable pp. 230\u2013235
        and p. 254. The proof that computability implies recursiveness requires no
        more knowledge of computable functions than the ideas underlying the definition:

        "I propose to consider the question, \"Can machines think?\" This should begin
        with definitions of the meaning of the terms \"machine\" and \"think.\" The
        definitions might be framed so as to reflect so far as possible the normal
        use of the words, but this attitude is dangerous. If the meaning of the words
        \"machine\" and \"think\" are to be found by examining how they are commonly
        used it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the meaning and the answer
        to the question, \"Can machines think?\" is to be sought in a statistical
        survey such as a Gallup poll. But this is absurd. Instead of attempting such
        a definition I shall replace the question by another, which is closely related
        to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words. The new form of the
        problem can be described in terms of a game which we call the \"imitation
        game.\" It is played with three people, a man (A), a woman (B), and an interrogator
        (C) who may be of either sex. The interrogator stays in a room apart'' from
        the other two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine
        which of the other two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by
        labels X and Y, and at the end of the game he says either \"X is A and Y is
        B\" or \"X is Band Y is A.\" The interrogator is allowed to put questions
        to A and B thus: C: Will X please tell me the length of his or her hair? Now
        suppose X is actually A, then A must answer. It is A''s object in the game
        to try and cause C to make the wrong identification. His answer might therefore
        be: \"My hair is shingled, and the longest strands are about nine inches long.

        "title": "Some Calculations of the Riemann Zeta-Function", "abstract": "Introduction
        IN June 1950 the Manchester University Mark 1 Electronic Computer was used
        to do some calculations concerned with the distribution of the zeros of the
        Riemann zeta-function. It was intended in fact to determine whether there
        are any zeros not on the critical line in certain particular intervals. The
        calculations had been planned some time in advance, but had in fact to be
        carried out in great haste. If it had not been for the fact that the computer
        remained in serviceable condition for an unusually long period from 3 p.m.
        one afternoon to 8 a.m. the following morning it is probable that the calculations
        would never have been done at all. As it was, the interval 2TT.63 < t < 2?r.64
        was investigated during that period, and very little more was accomplished.
        The calculations were done in an optimistic hope that a zero would be found
        off the critical line, and the calculations were directed more towards finding
        such zeros than proving that none existed. The procedure was such that if
        it had been accurately followed, and if the machine made no errors in the
        period, then one could be sure that there were no zeros off the critical line
        in the interval in question. In practice only a few of the results were checked
        by repeating the calculation, so that the machine might well have made an
        error. If more time had been available it was intended to do some more calculations
        in an altogether different spirit. There is no reason in principle why computation
        should not be carried through with the rigour usual in mathematical analysis.
        If definite rules are laid down as to how the computation is to be done one
        can predict bounds for the errors throughout. When the computations are done
        by hand there are serious practical difficulties about this. The computer
        will probably have his own ideas as to how certain steps should be done. When
        certain steps may be omitted without serious loss of accuracy he will wish
        to do so. Furthermore he will probably not see the point of the ''rigorous''
        computation and will probably say ''If you want more certainty about the accuracy
        why not just take more figures?'' an argument difficult to counter. However,
        if the calculations are being done by an automatic computer one can feel sure
        that this kind of indiscipline", "venue": "", "year": 1953, "referenceCount":

        "title": "The chemical basis of morphogenesis", "abstract": "It is suggested
        that a system of chemical substances, called morphogens, reacting together
        and diffusing through a tissue, is adequate to account for the main phenomena
        of morphogenesis. Such a system, although it may originally be quite homogeneous,
        may later develop a pattern or structure due to an instability of the homogeneous
        equilibrium, which is triggered off by random disturbances. Such reaction-diffusion
        systems are considered in some detail in the case of an isolated ring of cells,
        a mathematically convenient, though biologically unusual system. The investigation
        is chiefly concerned with the onset of instability. It is found that there
        are six essentially different forms which this may take. In the most interesting
        form stationary waves appear on the ring. It is suggested that this might
        account, for instance, for the tentacle patterns onHydra and for whorled leaves.
        A system of reactions and diffusion on a sphere is also considered. Such a
        system appears to account for gastrulation. Another reaction system in two
        dimensions gives rise to patterns reminiscent of dappling. It is also suggested
        that stationary waves in two dimensions could account for the phenomena of
        phyllotaxis.The purpose of this paper is to discuss a possible mechanism by
        which the genes of a zygote may determine the anatomical structure of the
        resulting organism. The theory does not make any new hypotheses; it merely
        suggests that certain well-known physical laws are sufficient to account for
        many of the facts. The full understanding of the paper requires a good knowledge
        of mathematics, some biology, and some elementary chemistry. Since readers
        cannot be expected to be experts in all of these subjects, a number of elementary
        facts are explained, which can be found in text-books, but whose omission
        would make the paper difficult reading.", "venue": "Philosophical transactions

        pp. Cased. $35. ISBN 978-0-3073-6144-8. Paper. $21. ISBN 978-0-3073-6146-2.The
        studies by these two historians address an important but undervalued subject
        - the role of Canada in the American Civil War. Richard Reid has examined
        the role of African-Canadian soldiers fighting in the civil war. John Boyko
        has attempted to provide a more general account of Canada''s experience of
        the civil war through the stories of six different Canadians.Richard Reid
        has made a meticulous study of the federal pension records and enlistment
        records to provide an account of African-Canadian experience in the American
        Civil War. He has taken on the daunting task of calculating the number of
        African-Canadians who actually participated in the war. Through painstaking
        research, he has identified 2,500 African-Canadians, resident in Canada, who
        fought for either the Union Army or Navy. Reid has demonstrated that Canadian
        participation was roughly equivalent to that of the New England states. Previous
        historians have portrayed the role of Canadianborn soldiers in the civil war
        as either mercenaries or victims of crimping (the illegal recruitment of soldiers
        through kidnapping or coercion). Reid amply demonstrates, at least in the
        case of African-Canadians, that this simply was not the case. He shows that
        the monetary benefits available for black soldiers through pay and bounties
        were unlikely to exceed what one could make by remaining in Canada, particularly
        for those with families. Furthermore, the timing of African-Canadian enrolment
        did not at all coincide with increasing bounties. Far more important in their
        decision-making was the equitable treatment of black soldiers. When black
        soldiers were first allowed to enrol, they found themselves limited by unequal
        pay, prevented from obtaining commissions and subject to excessive fatigue
        duty. There is little to object to in Reid''s new book. Perhaps one could
        have asked for a more in-depth account of how these black Canadian soldiers
        interacted with their American-born counterparts, and ideally he would provide
        more detail on how these soldiers related back to their friends and family
        in Canada, but the fragmentary nature of the source material likely makes
        such an endeavour unreasonable.Despite the seemingly narrow focus of the title,
        this book sheds light on a number of important issues: the issue of race in
        mid-nineteenth century North America; the porous border between the United
        States and Canada; and the importance of transnational ideologies and identities
        in the pre-Confederation era. Through a chapter on African-Canadian doctors,
        he tells the story of how blacks were able to break through into the medical
        industry in Canada more easily than in the United States. Later he demonstrates
        that the story does not simply end in 1865, as their war experiences influenced
        their lives long afterwards. \u2026", "venue": "", "year": 2015, "referenceCount":

        "On 15th May, 1951, on the Third Programme, Alan gave his first broadcast,
        which was one of a series with the general title \u201cAutomatic Calculating
        Machines.\u201d His lecture, the second in the series, bore the sub-title,
        \u201cCan Digital Computers Think?\u201d I heard at his house its recording,
        but he stoutly refused to join me, though he plucked up courage to listen
        to its repetition on 3rd July, 1951. It was, as far as I know, generally agreed
        that he put his case very clearly. The other participants in the series were:
        Professor M.H.A. Newman, F.R.S.; Professor F.C. Williams, F.R.S.; and Mr.
        M.V. Wilkes (later F.R.S.), who gave no sub-title to their lectures. These
        talks were all reasonably long, not those very short affairs that stop just
        as one is beginning to get interested. These lectures were followed on 14th
        January, 1952, by a fourcornered broadcast discussion on the Third Programme
        between Professor Sir Geoffrey Jefferson, F.R.S., Professor M.H.A. Newman,
        F.R.S., Mr. R.B. Braithwaite, Fellow of King''s College, Cambridge, and Alan.
        The subject was, \u201cCan Automatic Calculating Machines be said to Think?\u201d
        Alan vigorously maintained, with some mild support from Professor Newman,
        that they could be said to think and bore the brunt of their opponents'' objections,
        particularly those of Sir Geoffrey Jefferson. The general impression of my
        non-expert friends was that the subject had been presented most amusingly
        and in such a way as to be, on the whole, within the comprehension of those
        to whom it was quite new.", "venue": "", "year": 2012, "referenceCount": 0,

        A. Turing", "abstract": "T\ufeffhe purpose of this study is to explore the
        possibility of reconciliation between Kant\u2019s transcendental idealism
        and McCarthy\u2019s epistemological point of view on artificial intelligence,
        which are at first glance likely to be considered contradictory. For this,
        characterizing the standpoint of J. McCarthy, who coined the word \u2018artificial
        intelligence\u2019 as scientific realism and that of A. Turing, who provided
        a crucial thought experiment that shaped the contemporary conception of artificial
        intelligence as behaviorism, we shall compare these two standpoints with the
        transcendental idealism of I. Kant, who conferred on us a monumental indicator
        for understanding the human reason. T\ufeffhrough this comparison, we shall
        argue that scientific realism, which is currently a prominent philosophical
        standpoint of artificial intelligence, is not compatible with Kant\u2019s
        transcendental idealism but assumes a standpoint strikingly analogous to behaviorism.
        Nevertheless, we shall also argue that once transcendental idealism is looked
        at from the viewpoint of behaviorism, scientific realism can be seen as compatible
        with transcendental idealism. T\ufeffhis compatibility we name the possibility
        of artificial reason in this paper.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "referenceCount":

        "title": "Generative Grammar", "abstract": "AuQ: Please provide information
        for Greenblatt et al. (See text.) This text has been added to the text as
        a placeholder for that reference. text has been added to the text as a placeholder
        for that reference. This text has been added to the text as a placeholder
        for that reference. The motivating idea of generative grammar is that we can
        gain insight into human language through the construction of explicit grammars.
        A language is taken to be a collection of structured symbolic expressions,
        and a generative grammar is simply an explicit theoretical account of one
        such collection. Simple finite sets of rules can describe infinite languages
        with interesting structure. For example, the following instruction describes
        all palindromes over the alphabet {A, B}: Start with S and recursively replace
        S by ASA, BSB, or nothing. We prove that ABBA is a palindrome by constructing
        the sequence S\u2014ASA\u2014ABSBA\u2014ABBA, which represents a derivation
        of the string. The instruction, or rule, constitutes a generative grammar
        for the language comprising such pal-indromes; for every palindrome over the
        alphabet {A,B} the grammar provides a derivation. S can be regarded as a grammatical
        category analogous to a sentence, and A and B are analogous to words in a
        language. The following condition on nodes in trees turns out to be equivalent
        to the above grammar: Nodes labeled S have left and right daughters either
        both labeled A or both labeled B; optionally these are separated by a node
        labeled S; nodes labeled A or B have no daughters. If a set of trees T satisfies
        this condition, then its frontier (the sequence of daughterless nodes) is
        a palindrome of A''s and B''s; and any such palindrome is the frontier of
        some such tree. This is a declarative definition of a set of trees, not a
        procedure for deriving strings. But it provides an alternative way of defining
        the same language of strings, a different type of generative grammar. Studying
        English in generative terms involves trying to determine whether some finite
        set of rules could generate the entire set of strings of words that a native
        speaker of (say) English would find acceptable. It presumably is possible
        , because speakers, despite their finite mental capacities, seem to have a
        full grasp of what is in their language. A fundamental early insight was that
        limitations on the format of rules or constraints set limits on definable
        languages , \u2026", "venue": "", "year": null, "referenceCount": 13, "citationCount":

        elements during a snowfall near a building were examined by means of two dimensional
        numerical experiments which took into account a cylindrical building 10 m
        in radius and 22 m in height. Wilson''s selective ion capture process and
        the supplement of ions due to the corona discharge from the ground surface
        are considered in these experiments. As the electric field on the roof of
        the building is intensified, a corona discharge is liable to occur there and
        a large number of ions are emitted from the roof into the atmosphere. Although
        the ions move upward owing to the electric force, they cannot reach higher
        altitude and a high concentra tion of ions appear below a 40 m level. On the
        other hand, snow particles are rapidly electrified below the 60 m level. Therefore,
        ions emitted from the roof of the building are captured by snow particles
        and the charges on snow particles are released to the ground surface. These
        calculated results qualitatively agree with the observation results described
        in a previous paper (Asuma et al., 1988).", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "referenceCount":

        NGC 5322", "abstract": "We have analysed a new high-resolution e-MERLIN 1.5
        GHz radio continuum map together with HST and SDSS imaging of NGC 5322, an
        elliptical galaxy hosting radio jets, aiming to understand the galaxy\u2019s
        central structure and its connection to the nuclear activity. We decomposed
        the composite HST + SDSS surface brightness profile of the galaxy into an
        inner stellar disc, a spheroid, and an outer stellar halo. Past works showed
        that this embedded disc counter-rotates rapidly with respect to the spheroid.
        The HST images reveal an edge-on nuclear dust disc across the centre, aligned
        along the major-axis of the galaxy and nearly perpendicular to the radio jets.
        After careful masking of this dust disc, we find a central stellar mass deficit
        Mdef in the spheroid, scoured by SMBH binaries with final mass MBH such that
        Mdef/MBH \u223c 1.3 \u2212 3.4. We propose a three-phase formation scenario
        for NGC 5322 where a few (2 \u2212 7) \u2018dry\u2019 major mergers involving
        SMBHs built the spheroid with a depleted core. The cannibalism of a gas-rich
        satellite subsequently creates the faint counter-rotating disc and funnels
        gaseous material directly onto the AGN, powering the radio core with a brightness
        temperature of TB, core \u223c 4.5 \u00d7 107 K and the low-power radio jets
        (Pjets \u223c 7.04 \u00d7 1020 W Hz\u22121) which extend \u223c1.6 kpc. The
        outer halo can later grow via minor mergers and the accretion of tidal debris.
        The low-luminosity AGN/jet-driven feedback may have quenched the late-time
        nuclear star formation promptly, which could otherwise have replenished the
        depleted core.", "venue": "", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 148, "citationCount":

        "title": "The diversity of methanol maser morphologies from VLBI observations",
        "abstract": "Context. The 6.7 GHz methanol maser marks an early stage of high-mass
        star formation, but the origin of this maser is currently a matter of debate.
        In particular it is unclear whether the maser emission arises in discs, outflows
        or behind shocks running into rotating molecular clouds. Aims. We investigated
        which structures the methanol masers trace in the environment of high-mass
        protostar candidates by observing a homogenous sample of methanol masers selected
        from Torun surveys. We also probed their origins by looking for associated
        H II regions and IR emission. Methods. We selected 30 methanol sources with
        improved position accuracies achieved using MERLIN and another 3 from the
        literature. We imaged 31 of these using the European VLBI Network\u2019s expanded
        array of telescopes with 5-cm (6-GHz) receivers. We used the VLA to search
        for 8.4 GHz radio continuum counterparts and inspected Spitzer GLIMPSE data
        at 3.6\u20138 \u03bcm from the archive. Results. High angular resolution images
        allowed us to analyze the morphology and kinematics of the methanol masers
        in great detail and verify their association with radio continuum and mid-infrared
        emission. A new class of \u201cring-like\u201d methanol masers in starforming
        regions appeared to be suprisingly common, 29% of the sample. Conclusions.
        The new morphology strongly suggests that methanol masers originate in the
        disc or torus around a proto- or a young massive star. However, the maser
        kinematics indicate the strong influence of outflow or infall. This suggests
        that they form at the interface between the disc/torus and a flow. This is
        also strongly supported by Spitzer results because the majority of the masers
        coincide with 4.5 \u03bcm emission to within less than 1 \ufffd\ufffd . Only
        four masers are associated with the central parts of UC H II regions. This
        implies that 6.7 GHz methanol maser emission occurs before H II region observable
        at cm wavelengths is formed.", "venue": "", "year": 2009, "referenceCount":

        "The Herschel Multi-tiered Extragalactic Survey (HerMES) is a legacy programme
        designed to map a set of nested fields totalling \u223c380\u2009deg^2. Fields
        range in size from 0.01 to \u223c20\u2009deg^2, using the Herschel-Spectral
        and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE) (at 250, 350 and 500\u2009\u03bcm)
        and the Herschel-Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrometer (PACS) (at 100
        and 160\u2009\u03bcm), with an additional wider component of 270\u2009deg^2
        with SPIRE alone. These bands cover the peak of the redshifted thermal spectral
        energy distribution from interstellar dust and thus capture the reprocessed
        optical and ultraviolet radiation from star formation that has been absorbed
        by dust, and are critical for forming a complete multiwavelength understanding
        of galaxy formation and evolution. \n \nThe survey will detect of the order
        of 100\u2009000 galaxies at 5\u03c3 in some of the best-studied fields in
        the sky. Additionally, HerMES is closely coordinated with the PACS Evolutionary
        Probe survey. Making maximum use of the full spectrum of ancillary data, from
        radio to X-ray wavelengths, it is designed to facilitate redshift determination,
        rapidly identify unusual objects and understand the relationships between
        thermal emission from dust and other processes. Scientific questions HerMES
        will be used to answer include the total infrared emission of galaxies, the
        evolution of the luminosity function, the clustering properties of dusty galaxies
        and the properties of populations of galaxies which lie below the confusion
        limit through lensing and statistical techniques. \n \nThis paper defines

        stressing their role as standard-bearers of an aggressive form of reductionism|which
        we may term \\\\ne-grain modeling\". Cellular automata try to capture in abstract
        computational terms certain fundamental aspects of physics|such as uniformity,
        locality, and local niteness. At the same time, precisely because of this
        close match with physics, they provide a blueprint for very eecient ne-grained
        parallel computer architectures. The references to Occam, Turing, and von
        Neumann are canonical. The reference to Jaynes is in the following context.
        Recently, cellular automata have been found to be \\unreasonably eeective\"
        in modeling by simple nitary means phenomena that are traditionally viewed
        as a preserve of diierential equations and continuum methods. We try to show
        that there is really nothing unreasonable about this eeectivenes. Much as
        the maximum-entropy (i.e., \\most random\") distribution obeying certain constraints
        is the a priori best guess for the unknown distribution underlying a given
        statistics, thus a \\random\" cellular automaton obeying certain constraints
        is a very good bet for a microscopic model of a given macroscopic dynamics.

        "title": "Alan M. Turing: Broadcasts and Intelligent Machinery", "abstract":
        "On 15th May, 1951, on the Third Programme, Alan gave his first broadcast,
        which was one of a series with the general title \u201cAutomatic Calculating
        Machines.\u201d His lecture, the second in the series, bore the sub-title,
        \u201cCan Digital Computers Think?\u201d I heard at his house its recording,
        but he stoutly refused to join me, though he plucked up courage to listen
        to its repetition on 3rd July, 1951. It was, as far as I know, generally agreed
        that he put his case very clearly. The other participants in the series were:
        Professor M.H.A. Newman, F.R.S.; Professor F.C. Williams, F.R.S.; and Mr.
        M.V. Wilkes (later F.R.S.), who gave no sub-title to their lectures. These
        talks were all reasonably long, not those very short affairs that stop just
        as one is beginning to get interested. These lectures were followed on 14th
        January, 1952, by a fourcornered broadcast discussion on the Third Programme
        between Professor Sir Geoffrey Jefferson, F.R.S., Professor M.H.A. Newman,
        F.R.S., Mr. R.B. Braithwaite, Fellow of King''s College, Cambridge, and Alan.
        The subject was, \u201cCan Automatic Calculating Machines be said to Think?\u201d
        Alan vigorously maintained, with some mild support from Professor Newman,
        that they could be said to think and bore the brunt of their opponents'' objections,
        particularly those of Sir Geoffrey Jefferson. The general impression of my
        non-expert friends was that the subject had been presented most amusingly
        and in such a way as to be, on the whole, within the comprehension of those
        to whom it was quite new.", "venue": "", "year": 2012, "referenceCount": 0,

        Twin of the Active Electronically Scanned Array", "abstract": "A weather radar
        using an active electronically scanned array (AESA) enables rapid scanning
        of the antenna beam for Doppler and polarimetric radar observation measurements.
        An AESA consists of radiating elements, power amplifiers, attenuators, phase
        shifters, array controllers, and digital converters. This paper describes
        a digital twin, the AESA Simulator, which models both the AESA and weather
        radar returns, developed to explore and validate the optimal configuration
        of the APAR subsystems. Using a hybrid digital beamforming architecture, multiple,
        simultaneous receive beams are realized upon reception. Traditional analog
        beamforming will be performed along each row, while digital beamforming will
        be performed across the per-row outputs of the AESA. The simulator sums over
        a spatial grid, rather than using a prescribed antenna pattern, in order to
        support testing of multiple receive beams, clutter mitigation algorithms,
        and other developments that require accurate modeling of spatial diversity.
        The digital twin allowed NCAR/EOL to accelerate the timeline for engineering
        development of the APAR radar back end (RBE) and provides the necessary configurability
        to conform to the eventual AESA digital data acquisition and control interfaces
        as AESA and RBE development converge. Together the simulator and RBE are used
        to evaluate/validate the radar at the system level.", "venue": "IEEE International

        "To enter a federal district court, you must knock on the door of the federal
        courthouse and show a jurisdictional ticket. If the judge validates your ticket,
        you will be welcomed into federal court. On its face, this seems like a straightforward
        process. However, consider the following example: John and Mike enter an agreement
        that contains an arbitration clause. When the relationship deteriorates, John
        chooses to compel arbitration and seeks $100,000 from Mike. After the arbitration,
        John is awarded $70,000. John sues in federal court to confirm the arbitration
        award. Assuming John is seeking to establish diversity jurisdiction, John
        will have to satisfy the $75,000 amount in controversy requirement. Is the
        amount in controversy satisfied because John originally sought $100,000, or
        is $70,000 the amount in controversy in this dispute? The obvious answer is
        to look at how courts have handled similar disputes. Unfortunately, the answer
        will change depending on which circuit hears the case. 3 Moreover, some circuits
        have not provided a clear answer to this question. In fact, some courts within

        "title": "CSDs and Participant Default", "abstract": "Since the financial
        crisis there has been an increase in the degree and detail of regulation of
        CSDs, which are rightly recognised to be a core component in the smooth functioning
        of the financial system. One feature of the regulation of CSDs, as with other
        types of financial market infrastructure, is the requirement for default rules.
        The principal actions of a CSD when faced with a participant default will
        be to freeze the defaulter\u2019s accounts and cancel processing of unexecuted
        instructions. These actions are intended to protect the settlement system,
        and also appear to be a response to insolvency laws which disallow movements
        of an insolvent entity\u2019s property.<br><br>But the nature of \u2018default\u2019
        has also changed since the crisis. In particular, there are new ways of dealing
        with failing firms, through resolution. This paper argues that how CSDs should
        react to the failure of a participating financial institution has lagged behind
        developments in the handling of financial firm failures. In particular, the
        freeze-and-cancel principle seems less necessary in the context of modern
        settlement processing, and at odds with the objective of resolution, which
        is to continue, or restore, critical functions without undue fuss or delay.
        Given that at least some participants in CSDs are intermediaries, whose accounts
        contain securities belonging to customers, the policy of freeze-and-cancel
        could add to the disruption caused by a firm\u2019s failure rather than reduce
        it.<br><br>The paper argues that there is no need for freeze-and-cancel as
        regards client securities, or even proprietary assets. Furthermore, the process
        of resolution, which commonly involves the transfer of client-facing functions
        to a \u2018bridge bank\u2019, seems not to be fully catered for in CSD default
        or membership rules. Trying to create new arrangements in an emergency over
        a resolution weekend seems a poor way to achieve continuity. It is therefore
        suggested that CSDs should overhaul their approach to membership in relation
        to bridge banks, and facilitate the transfer of client accounts during resolution.<br>",

        "title": "The Extra-Territorial Regulation of Clearinghouses", "abstract":
        "This Article argues that post-Crisis reform of over-the-counter derivatives
        is in trouble. While regulators agree on the broad strokes of regulation,
        they diverge on detail, often on core issues like how clearinghouses should
        manage risk. In examining divergences between United States and Europe, this
        Article makes three points. First, divergences in clearinghouse regulation
        matter in derivatives markets because these markets are uniquely international
        in scope. Contracts involve counterparties in different countries. Many transactions
        comprise cross-border aspects lacking a geographical anchor. Where derivatives
        traders face uncertainty, they can be dis-incentivized from observing laws
        or motivated to seek out lowest-cost compliance options. Secondly, although
        both the United States and European Union have adopted common ground-rules,
        their approaches to implementation differ in matters of detail. Such divergences
        prevent regulators from recognizing each other\u2019s clearinghouses as sufficiently
        robust. Thirdly, while acknowledging that mutual recognition is the most appropriate
        way forward, substantial shortcomings exist with this approach. This Article
        highlights continuing areas of structural divergence \u2013 like access to
        emergency funding and bailouts \u2013 that impact the costs of E.U. and U.S.
        regimes. Where costs diverge, traders seek out avenues for regulatory arbitrage
        to lower their costs of compliance. In concluding, this Article explores implications
        for reform.", "venue": "", "year": 2015, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount":

        "title": "Property in Securities: A Comparative Study by Eva Micheler", "abstract":
        "It is, in a sense, a shocking thing that the law cannot tell you for sure
        whether you do or do not own something. Unfortunately the law of ownership
        of securities appears to be in such a state.Worse, this is not exclusively
        an English a\u00a5iction, and the laws ofmany EUmember states not only have
        diverse approaches to common legal problems relating to securities ownership
        but also a range of questionswhich are di\u2044cult if not impossible to answer
        with certainty and clarity. Reform is clearly needed if the EU\u2019s objective
        of a single market in investments is to be achieved. This book is a useful
        contribution to the understanding of why there are differences between the
        laws of member states. Dr Eva Micheler has been closely involved with the
        work of the EU Commission\u2019s \u2018\u2018Legal Certainty Project\u2019\u2019,
        which is intended to lead to a codi\u00a2ed system of law across the EU to
        improve harmony and certainty about the rights enjoyed by investorswho hold
        their securities in an account with an intermediary. She analyses the laws
        of England and Wales and compares them with those in Germany and Austria,
        pointing up the areas of similarity as well as the di\u00a1erences.What is
        heartening is that there are clearly many areas of similarity: the central
        thesis of the book is that convergence of laws, even across very di\u00a1erent
        legal traditions, is achievable. English readers will \u00a2nd the explanations
        of the law helpful, clear and informative. English law has evolved along a
        tortuous path through law and equity, with the result that simple questions
        like \u2018when does title pass?\u2019 cannot be answered simply. DrMicheler
        sets out amenu of possible answers to this question and analyses each of them
        clearly. It would be interesting to study the impact of the contract between
        buyer and seller on the moment at which title passes. English law has traditionally
        had greater respect for the ability of contracts to alter ownership, and it
        seems likely that modern English courts would allow title in securities to
        pass in equity at a time agreed between the parties, provided that the seller
        has done everything in its power to divest itself of the securities (these
        days, that will typically be sending dematerialised instructions to CREST).
        This is likely to be so even if some of the pre-requisites to a title transfer
        in equity which have historically been expected are missing. DrMicheler sets
        out the theories in away which can easily be understood by a student or a
        trainee being asked to research the problem, and can quickly be turned to
        practical use in advice to a client.The analysis is concise as well as being
        thorough, and expressed in a stylewhich is accessible and comprehensible to
        those unfamiliar with the English legal tradition, or feel that it is too
        long since they studied the subject in the classroom.The authorities (in particular
        the pragmatic decision inHunter vMoss [1994] 1WLR 452, which has been unfairly
        criticised by some academics) are analysed in a way which is sympathetic to
        the needs of the market. Practitioners dealingwith questions relating to transfers
        and settlement of German orAustrian securitieswill similarly \u00a2nd the
        description of the lawand how it has evolved into its current state informative
        and interesting. Possession of the Wertpapier ^ the value of the security
        is in the paper itself, not the shareholders\u2019 Reviews", "venue": "",

        a classical reaction-diusion system undergoing Tur- ing instability and augment
        it by an additional unilateral source term. We investigate its inuence on
        the Turing instability and on the character of re- sulting patterns. The nonsmooth
        positively homogeneous unilateral term v has favourable properties in spite
        of the fact that the standard linear stability analysis cannot be performed.
        We illustrate the importance of the nonsmooth- ness by a numerical case study,
        which shows that the Turing instability can considerably change if we replace
        this term by its arbitrarily precise smooth approximation. However, the nonsmooth
        unilateral term and all its approxi- mations yield qualitatively same patterns
        although not necessarily developing from arbitrarily small disturbances of
        the spatially homogeneous steady state. Further, we show that inserting the
        unilateral source into a classical system breaks the approximate symmetry
        and regularity of the classical patterns and yields asymmetric and irregular
        patterns. Moreover, a given system with a unilateral source produces spatial
        patterns even for diusion parameters with ratios closer to 1 than the same
        system without any unilateral term. Biologi- cally, these ndings can contribute

        in his paper of 1936 was to present a formally exact predicate with which
        the informal predicate \u2018can be calculated by means of an effective method\u2019

        Turing and Church proposed were, on the face of it, very different from one
        another, but they turned out to be equivalent, in the sense that each picks
        out the same set of mathematical functions. The Church-Turing thesis is the
        assertion that this set contains every function whose values can be obtained
        by a method satisfying the above conditions for effectiveness. (Clearly, if
        there were functions of which the informal predicate, but not the formal predicate,
        were true, then the latter would be less general than the former and so could
        not reasonably be employed to replace it.) When the thesis is expressed in

        performance comparison of healthcare providers is of interest, characteristics
        of both patients and the health condition of interest must be balanced across
        providers for a fair comparison. This is unlikely to be feasible within observational
        data, as patient population characteristics may vary geographically and patient
        care may vary by characteristics of the health condition. We simulated data
        for patients and providers, based on a previously utilized real-world dataset,
        and separately considered both binary and continuous covariate-effects at
        the upper level. Multilevel latent class (MLC) modelling is proposed to partition
        a prediction focus at the patient level (accommodating casemix) and a causal
        inference focus at the provider level. The MLC model recovered a range of
        simulated Trust-level effects. Median recovered values were almost identical
        to simulated values for the binary Trust-level covariate, and we observed
        successful recovery of the continuous Trust-level covariate with at least
        3 latent Trust classes. Credible intervals widen as the error variance increases.
        The MLC approach successfully partitioned modelling for prediction and for
        causal inference, addressing the potential conflict between these two distinct
        analytical strategies. This improves upon strategies which only adjust for
        differential selection. Patient-level variation and measurement uncertainty

        we introduce a new class of probabilistic graphical models called the Reduced
        Dynamic Chain Event Graph (RDCEG) which is a novel mixture of a Chain Event
        Graph (CEG) and a semi-Markov process (SMP). It has been demonstrated that
        many real-world scenarios, particularly in the domain of public health and
        security, can be modelled as an unfolding of events in the life histories
        of individuals. Our interest not only lies in the future trajectories of an
        individual with a specified history and set of characteristics but also in
        the timescale associated with these developments. Such information is critical
        in developing suitable interventions and informs the prioritisation of policy
        decisions. The RDCEG was born out of the need for such a model. It is a coloured
        graph which inherits useful properties like fast conjugate model selection,
        conditional independence interrogations and a support for causal interventions
        from the family of probabilistic graphical models. Its novelty lies in its
        underlying semi-Markov structure which offers the flexibility of the holding
        time at each state being any arbitrary distribution. We demonstrate this new
        decision support system with a simulated intervention to reduce falls in the

        "title": "Convolutional neural networks for direct detection of dark matter",
        "abstract": "The XENON1T experiment uses a time projection chamber (TPC) with
        liquid Xenon to search for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), a
        proposed Dark Matter particle, via direct detection. As this experiment relies
        on capturing rare events, the focus is on achieving a high recall of WIMP
        events. Hence the ability to distinguish between WIMP and the background is
        extremely important. To accomplish this, we suggest using Convolutional Neural
        Networks (CNNs); a Machine Learning procedure mainly used in image recognition
        tasks. To explore this technique we use XENON collaboration open-source software
        to simulate the TPC graphical output of Dark Matter signals and main backgrounds.
        A CNN turns out to be a suitable tool for this purpose, as it can identify
        features in the images that differentiate the two types of events without
        the need to manipulate or remove data in order to focus on a particular region
        of the detector. We find that the CNN can distinguish between the dominant
        background events (ER) and 500 GeV WIMP events with a recall of 93.4\\%, precision
        of 81.2\\% and an accuracy of 87.2\\%.", "venue": "", "year": 2019, "referenceCount":

        "title": "Hybrid Chaotic Radial Basis Function Neural Oscillatory Network
        (HCRBFNON) for Financial Forecast and Trading System", "abstract": "Nowadays,
        financial prediction and trading are two major topics in financial engineering
        and the application of artificial intelligence. In this paper, we proposed
        a hybrid chaotic radial basis function neural oscillatory network (HCRBFNON)
        based foreign exchange (Forex) product price series prediction and quantum
        price levels based hedging trading system. In our forecasting system, the
        HCRBFNON consists of three components: 1) Quantum Finance Theory to model
        the secondary financial market and extract the financial dynamic energy level
        feature, 2) Long short-term memory mechanism to extract the temporal financial
        feature, 3) Chaotic type-2 transient-fuzzy membership function based transient
        chaotic radial basis layer to model the highly chaotic financial time series.
        In the quantum finance hedging & trading system (QFHTS), we employ the forecasting
        prices from the HCRBFNON and the respective nearest quantum price levels to
        construct the trading timing capture. In the model evaluation, we measure
        the performance CRBFNON with 5 popular models used in financial time series
        prediction; we also compared the trading performance of QFHTS with 2 classical
        technical analysis-based trading strategies. By using 12 most popular forex
        product datasets from 2011 to 2019 for the system testing, the experimental
        results revealed that both the HCRBFNON and QFHTS achieve promising results
        in terms of forecast and trading performances respectively.", "venue": "2019

        models", "abstract": "This study proposes a radically alternate approach for
        extracting quantitative information from schlieren images. The method uses
        a scaled, derivative enhanced Gaussian process model to obtain true density
        estimates from two corresponding schlieren images with the knife-edge at horizontal
        and vertical orientations. We illustrate our approach on schlieren images
        taken from a wind tunnel sting model, a supersonic aircraft in \ufb02ight,
        and a high-order numerical shock tube simulation.", "venue": "", "year": 2022,
