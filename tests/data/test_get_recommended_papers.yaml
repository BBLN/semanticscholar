        "title": "INDUCED SUBGRAPHS AND TREE DECOMPOSITIONS", "abstract": ". We say
        a class C of graphs is clean if for every positive integer t there exists
        a positive integer w ( t ) such that every graph in C with treewidth more
        than w ( t ) contains an induced subgraph isomorphic to one of the following:
        the complete graph K t , the complete bipartite graph K t,t , a subdivision
        of the ( t \u00d7 t )-wall or the line graph of a subdivision of the ( t \u00d7
        t )-wall. In this paper, we adapt a method due to Lozin and Razgon (building
        on earlier ideas of Wei\u00dfauer) to prove that the class of all H -free
        graphs (that is, graphs with no induced subgraph isomorphic to a fixed graph
        H ) is clean if and only if H is a forest whose components are subdivided
        stars. Their method is readily applied to yield the above characterization.
        However, our main result is much stronger: for every forest H as above, we
        show that forbidding certain connected graphs containing H as an induced subgraph
        (rather than H itself) is enough to obtain a clean class of graphs. Along
        the proof of the latter strengthening, we build on a result of Davies and
        produce, for every positive integer \u03b7 , a complete description of unavoidable
        connected induced subgraphs of a connected graph G containing \u03b7 vertices
        from a suitably large given set of vertices in G . This is of independent
        interest, and will be used in subsequent papers in this series.", "venue":

        Graphs", "abstract": "We study the reverse shortest path problem on disk graphs
        in the plane. In this problem we consider the proximity graph of a set of
        $n$ disks in the plane of arbitrary radii: In this graph two disks are connected
        if the distance between them is at most some threshold parameter $r$. The
        case of intersection graphs is a special case with $r=0$. We give an algorithm
        that, given a target length $k$, computes the smallest value of $r$ for which
        there is a path of length at most $k$ between some given pair of disks in
        the proximity graph. Our algorithm runs in $O^*(n^{5/4})$ randomized expected
        time, which improves to $O^*(n^{6/5})$ for unit disk graphs, where all the
        disks have the same radius. Our technique is robust and can be applied to
        many variants of the problem. One significant variant is the case of weighted
        proximity graphs, where edges are assigned real weights equal to the distance
        between the disks or between their centers, and $k$ is replaced by a target
        weight $w$; that is, we seek a path whose length is at most $w$. In other
        variants, we want to optimize a parameter different from $r$, such as a scale
        factor of the radii of the disks. The main technique for the decision version
        of the problem (determining whether the graph with a given $r$ has the desired
        property) is based on efficient implementations of BFS (for the unweighted
        case) and of Dijkstra''s algorithm (for the weighted case), using efficient
        data structures for maintaining the bichromatic closest pair for certain bicliques
        and several distance functions. The optimization problem is then solved by
        combining the resulting decision procedure with enhanced variants of the interval

        "title": "Oriented Spanners", "abstract": "Given a point set $P$ in the Euclidean
        plane and a parameter $t$, we define an \\emph{oriented $t$-spanner} as an
        oriented subgraph of the complete bi-directed graph such that for every pair
        of points, the shortest cycle in $G$ through those points is at most a factor
        $t$ longer than the shortest oriented cycle in the complete bi-directed graph.
        We investigate the problem of computing sparse graphs with small oriented
        dilation. As we can show that minimising oriented dilation for a given number
        of edges is NP-hard in the plane, we first consider one-dimensional point
        sets. While obtaining a $1$-spanner in this setting is straightforward, already
        for five points such a spanner has no plane embedding with the leftmost and
        rightmost point on the outer face. This leads to restricting to oriented graphs
        with a one-page book embedding on the one-dimensional point set. For this
        case we present a dynamic program to compute the graph of minimum oriented
        dilation that runs in $O(n^8)$ time for $n$ points, and a greedy algorithm
        that computes a $5$-spanner in $O(n\\log n)$ time. Expanding these results
        finally gives us a result for two-dimensional point sets: we prove that for
        convex point sets the greedy triangulation results in an oriented $O(1)$-spanner.",

        in graphs have been studied for a long time, achieving important results in
        both theoretical and practical aspects. Over the decades, many variations
        of matching problems and results were studied. Some of them can be solved
        in polynomial time, while others apparently cannot, unless P = NP. In this
        thesis, we briefly present the history of matching problems and their complexities,
        along with a survey of some of their variations, and their state-of-the-art.
        We also give new results on one of these variations: P-matchings. A matching
        M is a P-matching if the subgraph induced by the endpoints of the edges of
        M satisfies property P . As examples, for appropriate choices of P , the problems
        INDUCED MATCHING, UNIQUELY RESTRICTED MATCHING, ACYCLIC MATCHING, CONNECTED
        MATCHING and DISCONNECTED MATCHING arise. In this thesis, we focus our study
        on three: DISCONNECTED MATCHING, CONNECTED MATCHING and its weighted version,
        WEIGHTED CONNECTED MATCHING. To this end, we developed NPcompleteness proofs,
        classical and parameterized complexity analysis, as well as exact polynomial
        algorithms, considering these problems in general and subject to some constraints.",

        the Planar Disjoint Paths problem, one is given an undirected planar graph
        with a set of $k$ vertex pairs $(s_i,t_i)$ and the task is to find $k$ pairwise
        vertex-disjoint paths such that the $i$-th path connects $s_i$ to $t_i$. We
        study the problem through the lens of kernelization, aiming at efficiently
        reducing the input size in terms of a parameter. We show that Planar Disjoint
        Paths does not admit a polynomial kernel when parameterized by $k$ unless
        coNP $\\subseteq$ NP/poly, resolving an open problem by [Bodlaender, Thomass{\\''e},
        Yeo, ESA''09]. Moreover, we rule out the existence of a polynomial Turing
        kernel unless the WK-hierarchy collapses. Our reduction carries over to the
        setting of edge-disjoint paths, where the kernelization status remained open
        even in general graphs. On the positive side, we present a polynomial kernel
        for Planar Disjoint Paths parameterized by $k + tw$, where $tw$ denotes the
        treewidth of the input graph. As a consequence of both our results, we rule

        "title": "Approximation Algorithms for Partial Vertex Covers in Trees", "abstract":
        "This paper is concerned with designing algorithms for and analyzing the computational
        complexity of the partial vertex cover problem in trees. Graphs (and trees)
        are frequently used to model risk management in various systems. In particular,
        Caskurlu et al. in [4] have considered a system which essentially represents
        a tripartite graph. The goal in this model is to reduce the risk in the system
        below a predefined risk threshold level. It can be shown that the main goal
        in this risk management system can be formulated as a Partial Vertex Cover
        problem on bipartite graphs. In this paper, we focus on a special case of
        the partial vertex cover problem, when the input graph is a tree. We consider
        four possible versions of this setting, depending on whether or not, the vertices
        and edges are weighted. Two of these versions, where edges are assumed to
        be unweighted, are known to be polynomial-time solvable. However, the computational
        complexity of this problem with weighted edges, and possibly with weighted
        vertices, remained open. The main contribution of this paper is to resolve
        these questions by fully characterizing which variants of partial vertex cover
        remain NP-hard in trees, and which can be solved in polynomial time. In the
        paper, we propose two pseudo-polynomial DP-based algorithms for the most general
        case in which weights are present on both the edges and the vertices of the
        tree. One of these algorithms leads to a polynomial-time procedure, when weights
        are confined to the edges of the tree. The insights used in this algorithm
        are combined with additional scaling ideas to derive an FPTAS for the general
        case. A secondary contribution of this work is to propose a novel way of using
        centroid decompositions in trees, which could be useful in other settings
        as well.", "venue": "International Journal of Foundations of Computer Science",

        that a hyperedge can only be intact if all its nodes are undamaged. This scenario
        applies for instance to supply chains where the production of a product requires
        all raw materials and all processing steps; in biology it applies to protein-interaction
        networks where protein complexes can only function if all the proteins are
        present, and it applies as well to chemical reaction networks where a chemical
        reaction can take place only when all the reactants are present. Formulating
        a message-passing theory for hypergraph $k$-core percolation, and combining
        it with the theory of critical phenomena on networks we demonstrate that the
        set of $k$-core problems for locally tree-like hypergraphs is much richer
        than for ordinary graphs. In particular we define a pruning process acting
        on nodes as well as on hyperedges depending on their connectivity and we demonstrate
        sharp differences with previously studied factor graph $k$-core percolation
        processes where it is allow for hyperedges to have one or more damaged nodes
        and still be intact. Furthermore we define a set of pruning processes that
        act either exclusively on nodes or exclusively on hyperedges and depend of
        their second-neighborhood connectivity. We show that the resulting second-neighbor
        $k$-core percolation problems are significantly distinct with each other and
        we reveal their relation to hypergraph and factor graph $k$-core percolation

        "title": "Balanced Separator Theorem for Unit Disk Graphs with Applications",
        "abstract": ". In this paper, we establish a novel balanced separator theorem
        for Unit Disk Graphs (UDGs) , which mimics the well-known Lipton and Tarjan\u2019s
        planar balanced shortest paths separator theorem. We prove that, in any n
        -vertex UDG G , one can \ufb01nd two hop-shortest paths P ( s, x ) and P (
        s, y ) such that the removal of the 3-hop-neighborhood of these paths (i.e.,
        N 3 G [ P ( s, x ) \u222a P ( s, y )]) from G leaves no connected component
        with more than 2 / 3 n vertices. This new balanced shortest-paths\u20143-hop-neighborhood
        separator theorem allows us to build, for any n -vertex UDG G , a system T
        ( G ) of at most 2 log 3 2 n + 2 spanning trees of G such that, for any two
        vertices x and y of G , there exists a tree T in T ( G ) with d T ( x, y )
        \u2264 3 \u00b7 d G ( x, y ) + 12. That is, the distances in any UDG can be
        approximately represented by the distances in at most 2 log 32 n + 2 of its
        spanning trees. Using these results, we propose a new compact and low delay
        routing labeling scheme for UDGs. They often model wireless ad hoc networks.
        We show that one can assign each vertex of an n -vertex UDG G a compact O
        (log 2 n )-bit label such that, given the label of a source vertex and the
        label of a destination, it is possible to compute e\ufb03ciently, based solely
        on these two labels, a neighbor of the source vertex that heads in the direction
        of the destination. We prove that this routing labeling scheme has a constant
        hop route-stretch (= hop delay ), i.e., for each two vertices x and y of G
        , it produces a routing path with h ( x, y ) hops (edges) such that h ( x,
        y ) \u2264 3 \u00b7 d G ( x, y ) + 12, where d G ( x, y ) is the hop distance
        between x and y in G . To the best of our knowledge, this is the \ufb01rst
        compact routing scheme for UDGs which not only guaranties delivery but has
        a low hop delay. It is easy to see that, for UDGs, a constant hop route-stretch
        implies a constant length route-stretch and a constant power route-stretch

        Since the graph is undirected, the number of edges from a red vertex to a

        the probability that a random walk starting from a red vertex stays within
        the red class for at least $2$ steps is $x$, and the corresponding probability

        We also give a fixed-parameter-tractable algorithm for digraphs when parameterized

        Shortest Paths (Abstract)", "abstract": "The single-source shortest-path problem
        is as follows: given a graph with nonnegative edge weights and a designated
        source vertex s, return the distances from~s to each other vertex such. This
        paper presents a randomized parallel single-source shortest paths (SSSP) algorithm
        for directed graphs with non-negative integer edge weights that solves the
        exact SSSP problem in O (m) work and n^1/2+o(1) span, with high probability.
        All previous exact SSSP algorithms with nearly linear work have linear span,
        even for undirected unweighted graphs. To solve exact SSSP problem, we first
        show a deterministic reduction from exact SSSP to directed hopsets using the
        iterative gradual rounding technique. An (\u03b2, \u03b5)-hopset is a set
        of weighted edges, also known as shortcuts, that when added to the graph,
        admit \u03b2-hop paths with weights no more than (1 + \u03b5) times the true
        shortest path distances. We show that (\u03b2, \u03b5)-hopsets can be used
        to solve the exact SSSP problem in O (m) work and O (\u03b2) span. Furthermore,
        we present the first nearly linear-work algorithm for constructing hopsets
        on directed graphs. Our sequential algorithm runs in O (m) time and constructs
        a hopset with O (n) edges and \u03b2 = n^1/2+o(1) . We also provide a parallel
        version of the algorithm with O (m) work and n^1/2+o(1) span. The directed
        hopsets can be used to solve approximate SSSP problems efficiently, where
        the objective is to return estimates of the distances from the source vertex

        are a number of well-known problems and conjectures about partitioning graphs
        to satisfy local constraints. For example, the majority colouring conjecture
        of Kreutzer, Oum, Seymour, van der Zypen and Wood states that every directed
        graph has a 3-colouring such that for every vertex $v$, at most half of the
        out-neighbours of $v$ have the same colour as $v$. As another example, the
        internal partition conjecture, due to DeVos and to Ban and Linial, states
        that for every $d$, all but finitely many $d$-regular graphs have a partition
        into two nonempty parts such that for every vertex $v$, at least half of the
        neighbours of $v$ lie in the same part as $v$. We prove several results in

        "We revisit the Heaviest Induced Ancestors (HIA) problem that was introduced
        by Gagie, Gawrychowski, and Nekrich [CCCG 2013] and has a number of applications
        in string algorithms. Let T1 and T2 be two rooted trees whose nodes have weights
        that are increasing in all root-to-leaf paths, and labels on the leaves, such
        that no two leaves of a tree have the same label. A pair of nodes (u, v) \u2208
        T1 \u00d7 T2 is induced if and only if there is a label shared by leaf-descendants
        of u and v. In an HIA query, given nodes x \u2208 T1 and y \u2208 T2, the
        goal is to find an induced pair of nodes (u, v) of the maximum total weight
        such that u is an ancestor of x and v is an ancestor of y. Let n be the upper
        bound on the sizes of the two trees. It is known that no data structure of
        size \u00d5(n) can answer HIA queries in o(log n/ log log n) time [Charalampopoulos,
        Gawrychowski, Pokorski; ICALP 2020].1 This (unconditional) lower bound is
        a polyloglog n factor away from the query time of the fastest \u00d5(n)-size
        data structure known to date for the HIA problem [Abedin, Hooshmand, Ganguly,
        Thankachan; Algorithmica 2022]. In this work, we resolve the query-time complexity
        of the HIA problem for the near-linear space regime by presenting a data structure
        that can be built in \u00d5(n) time and answers HIA queries in O(log n/ log
        log n) time. As a direct corollary, we obtain an \u00d5(n)-size data structure
        that maintains the LCS of a static string and a dynamic string, both of length
        at most n, in time optimal for this space regime. The main ingredients of
        our approach are fractional cascading and the utilization of an O(log n/ log
        log n)-depth tree decomposition. The latter allows us to break through the
        \u03a9(log n) barrier faced by previous works, due to the depth of the considered
        heavy-path decompositions. 2012 ACM Subject Classification Theory of computation

        graph theory is the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used
        to model pairwise relations between objects. A graph G is a pair G = (V, E),
        where V and E are the vertex set and the edge set of G, respectively. The
        order and size of G is the number of vertices and edges of G, respectively.
        The degree or valency of a vertex u in a graph G (loopless), denoted by deg
        (u), is the number of edges meeting at u. If, for every vertex \u03bd in G,
        deg (\u03bd) = k, we say that G is a k-regular graph. The cycle of order n
        is denoted by Cn and is a connected 2-regular graph. The path graph of order
        n is denoted by Pn and obtain by deleting an edge of Cn. A tree is an undirected
        graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path, or equivalently
        a connected undirected graph without cycle. A leaf (or pendant vertex) of
        a tree is a vertex of the tree of degree 1. An edge of a graph is said to
        be pendant if one of its vertices is a pendant vertex. A complete bipartite
        graph is a graph G with and such that every vertex of the set (part) X is
        connected to every vertex of the set (part) Y. If , then this graph is denoted
        by Km,n. The complete bipartite graph K1,n is called the star graph which
        has n + 1 vertices. The distance between two vertices u and \u03bd of G, denoted
        by d (u, \u03bd), is defined as the minimum number of edges of the walks between
        them. The complement of graph G is denoted by and is a graph with the same
        vertices such that two distinct vertices of are adjacent if, and only if,
        they are not adjacent in G. For more information on graphs, refer to [1].",

        graph cover, also known as locally bijective homomorphism, is a discretization
        of covering spaces known from general topology. It is a pair of incidence-preserving
        vertex- and edge-mappings between two graphs, the edge-component being bijective
        on the edge-neighborhoods of every vertex and its image. In line with the
        current trends in topological graph theory and its applications in mathematical
        physics, graphs are considered in the most relaxed form and as such they may
        contain multiple edges, loops and semi-edges. Nevertheless, simple graphs
        (binary structures without multiple edges, loops, or semi-edges) play an important
        role. The Strong Dichotomy Conjecture of Bok et al. [2022] states that for
        every fixed graph $H$, deciding if an input graph covers $H$ is either polynomial
        time solvable for arbitrary input graphs, or NP-complete for simple ones.
        These authors introduced the following quasi-order on the class of connected
        graphs: A connected graph $A$ is called {\\em stronger than} a connected graph
        $B$ if every simple graph that covers $A$ also covers $B$. Witnesses of $A$
        not being stronger than $B$ are {\\em generalized snarks} in the sense that
        they are simple graphs that cover $A$ but do not cover $B$. Bok et al. conjectured
        that if $A$ has no semi-edges, then $A$ is stronger than $B$ if and only if
        $A$ covers $B$. We prove this conjecture for cubic one-vertex graphs, and

        A perfect matching of G is a set of edges, M \u2286 E(G), such that each vertex

        |\u2202(X)| denotes the set of edges with precisely one end in X. One of the

        is a generalization of a graph that arises naturally when we consider attribute-sharing
        among entities. Although a hypergraph can be converted into a graph by expanding
        its hy-peredges into fully connected subgraphs, going the reverse way is computationally
        complex and NP-complete. We hence hypothesize that a hypergraph contains more
        information than a graph. Moreover, it is more convenient to manipulate a
        hypergraph directly, rather than expanding it into a graph. An open problem
        in hypergraphs is how to accurately and efficiently calculate their node distances.
        Once node distances are defined, we can find a node\u2019s nearest neighbors,
        and perform label propagation on hyper-graphs using a K-nearest neighbors
        (KNN) approach. In this paper, we propose two methods to achieve this. In
        the first, we compute expected hitting times of random walks on a hypergraph
        as node distances; in the second, we generalize the DeepWalk method to hypergraphs.
        We note that simple random walks (SRW) cannot accurately describe highly complex
        real-world hypergraphs, which motivates us to introduce frustrated random
        walks (FRW) to better describe them. Using real-world datasets, we show that
        FRW and DeepWalk can beat SRW with a large margin. For large and sparse hypergraphs,
        our method for computing the expected hitting times of random walks is approximately
        linear in time complexity, rendering it superior to the DeepWalk method.",

        "title": "BUILDING MINIMUM SPANNING TREES BY LIMITED NUMBER OF NODES OVER
        TRIANGULATED SET OF INITIAL NODES", "abstract": "Background. The common purpose
        of modelling and using minimum spanning trees is to ensure efficient coverage.
        In many tasks of designing efficient telecommunication networks, the number
        of network nodes is usually limited. In terms of rational allocation, there
        are more possible locations than factually active tools to be settled to those
        locations. \nObjective. Given an initial set of planar nodes, the problem
        is to build a minimum spanning tree connecting a given number of the nodes,
        which can be less than the cardinality of the initial set. The root node is
        primarily assigned, but it can be changed if needed. \nMethods. To obtain
        a set of edges, a Delaunay triangulation is performed over the initial set
        of nodes. Distances between every pair of the nodes in respective edges are
        calculated. These distances being the lengths of the respective edges are
        used as graph weights, and a minimum spanning tree is built over this graph.
        \nResults. The problem always has a solution if the desired number of nodes
        (the number of available recipient nodes) is equal to the number of initially
        given nodes. If the desired number is lesser, the maximal edge length is found
        and the edges of the maximal length are excluded while the number of minimum
        spanning tree nodes is greater than the desired number of nodes. \nConclusions.
        To build a minimum spanning tree by a limited number of nodes it is suggested
        to use the Delaunay triangulation and an iterative procedure in order to meet
        the desired number of nodes. Planar nodes of an initial set are triangulated,
        whereupon the edge lengths are used as weights of a graph. The iterations
        to reduce nodes are done only if there are redundant nodes. When failed, the
        root node must be changed before the desired number of nodes is changed.",

        "title": "On Diameter Approximation in Directed Graphs", "abstract": "Computing
        the diameter of a graph, i.e. the largest distance, is a fundamental problem
        that is central in fine-grained complexity. In undirected graphs, the Strong
        Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) yields a lower bound on the time vs. approximation
        trade-off that is quite close to the upper bounds. In \\emph{directed} graphs,
        however, where only some of the upper bounds apply, much larger gaps remain.
        Since $d(u,v)$ may not be the same as $d(v,u)$, there are multiple ways to
        define the problem, the two most natural being the \\emph{(one-way) diameter}
        ($\\max_{(u,v)} d(u,v)$) and the \\emph{roundtrip diameter} ($\\max_{u,v}
        d(u,v)+d(v,u)$). In this paper we make progress on the outstanding open question
        for each of them. -- We design the first algorithm for diameter in sparse
        directed graphs to achieve $n^{1.5-\\varepsilon}$ time with an approximation
        factor better than $2$. The new upper bound trade-off makes the directed case
        appear more similar to the undirected case. Notably, this is the first algorithm
        for diameter in sparse graphs that benefits from fast matrix multiplication.
        -- We design new hardness reductions separating roundtrip diameter from directed
        and undirected diameter. In particular, a $1.5$-approximation in subquadratic
        time would refute the All-Nodes $k$-Cycle hypothesis, and any $(2-\\varepsilon)$-approximation
        would imply a breakthrough algorithm for approximate $\\ell_{\\infty}$-Closest-Pair.

        "Size-Ramsey numbers are a central notion in combinatorics and have been widely
        studied since their introduction by Erd\\H{o}s, Faudree, Rousseau and Schelp
        in 1978. Research has mainly focused on the size-Ramsey numbers of $n$-vertex
        graphs with constant maximum degree $\\Delta$. For example, graphs which also
        have constant treewidth are known to have linear size-Ramsey numbers. On the
        other extreme, the canonical examples of graphs of unbounded treewidth are
        the grid graphs, for which the best known bound has only very recently been
        improved from $O(n^{3/2})$ to $O(n^{5/4})$ by Conlon, Nenadov and Truji\\''c.
        In this paper, we prove a common generalization of these results by establishing
        new bounds on the size-Ramsey numbers in terms of treewidth (which may grow
        as a function of $n$). As a special case, this yields a bound of $\\tilde{O}(n^{3/2
        - 1/2\\Delta})$ for proper minor-closed classes of graphs. In particular,
        this bound applies to planar graphs, addressing a question of Wood. Our proof

        how graph theory could somehow give a clue to the description of a problem

        Graphs", "abstract": "A relevant problem in combinatorial mathematics is the
        problem of counting independent sets of a graph G, denoted by i(G). This problem
        has many applications in combinatorics, physics, chemistry and computer science.
        For example, in statistical physics, the computation of i(G) has been useful
        in studying the behavior of the particles of a gas on a space modeled by a
        grid structure. Regarding hard counting problems, the computation of i(G)
        for a graph G has been key to determining the frontier between efficient counting
        and intractable counting procedures. In this article, a novel algorithm for
        counting independent sets on grid-like structures is presented. We propose
        a novel algorithm for the computation of i(Gm,n) for a grid graph with m rows
        and n columns based on the \u2018Branch and Bound\u2019 design technique.
        The splitting rule in our proposal is based on the well-known vertex reduction
        rule. The vertex in any subgraph from Gm,n, which is to be selected for the
        reduction rule, must have four internal incident faces. The ramification process
        is used to build a computation tree. Our proposal consists of decomposing
        the initial grid graph until outerplanar graphs are obtained as the \u2018basic
        subgrids\u2019 associated with the leave nodes of the computation tree. The
        resulting time-complexity of our proposal is inferior to the time-complexity
        of other classic methods, such as the transfer matrix method.", "venue": "IOCMA

        "title": "On the hardness of finding balanced independent sets in random bipartite
        graphs", "abstract": "We consider the algorithmic problem of finding large
        \\textit{balanced} independent sets in sparse random bipartite graphs, and
        more generally the problem of finding independent sets with specified proportions
        of vertices on each side of the bipartition. In a bipartite graph it is trivial
        to find an independent set of density at least half (take one of the partition
        classes). In contrast, in a random bipartite graph of average degree $d$,
        the largest balanced independent sets (containing equal number of vertices
        from each class) are typically of density $(2+o_d(1)) \\frac{\\log d}{d}$.
        Can we find such large balanced independent sets in these graphs efficiently?
        By utilizing the overlap gap property and the low-degree algorithmic framework,
        we prove that local and low-degree algorithms (even those that know the bipartition)
        cannot find balanced independent sets of density greater than $(1+\\epsilon)
        \\frac{\\log d}{d}$ for any $\\epsilon>0$ fixed and $d$ large but constant.
        This factor $2$ statistical--computational gap between what exists and what
        local algorithms can achieve is analogous to the gap for finding large independent
        sets in (non-bipartite) random graphs. Our results therefor suggest that this
        gap is pervasive in many models, and that hard computational problems can
        lurk inside otherwise tractable ones. A particularly striking aspect of the
        gap in bipartite graphs is that the algorithm achieving the lower bound is
        extremely simple and can be implemented as a $1$-local algorithm and a degree-$1$
        polynomial (a linear function).", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

        "title": "Delaying Decisions and Reservation Costs", "abstract": "We study
        the Feedback Vertex Set and the Vertex Cover problem in a natural variant
        of the classical online model that allows for delayed decisions and reservations.
        Both problems can be characterized by an obstruction set of subgraphs that
        the online graph needs to avoid. In the case of the Vertex Cover problem,
        the obstruction set consists of an edge (i.e., the graph of two adjacent vertices),
        while for the Feedback Vertex Set problem, the obstruction set contains all
        cycles. In the delayed-decision model, an algorithm needs to maintain a valid
        partial solution after every request, thus allowing it to postpone decisions
        until the current partial solution is no longer valid for the current request.
        The reservation model grants an online algorithm the new and additional option
        to pay a so-called reservation cost for any given element in order to delay
        the decision of adding or rejecting it until the end of the instance. For
        the Feedback Vertex Set problem, we first analyze the variant with only delayed
        decisions, proving a lower bound of $4$ and an upper bound of $5$ on the competitive
        ratio. Then we look at the variant with both delayed decisions and reservation.
        We show that given bounds on the competitive ratio of a problem with delayed
        decisions impliy lower and upper bounds for the same problem when adding the
        option of reservations. This observation allows us to give a lower bound of
        $\\min{\\{1+3\\alpha,4\\}}$ and an upper bound of $\\min{\\{1+5\\alpha,5\\}}$
        for the Feedback Vertex Set problem. Finally, we show that the online Vertex
        Cover problem, when both delayed decisions and reservations are allowed, is

        is to find a small collection of drawings such that they all together satisfy
        some property that is useful for graph visualization. We propose investigating
        a property where each edge is not crossed in at least one drawing in the collection.
        We call such collection uncrossed. Such property is motivated by a quintessential
        problem of the crossing number, where one asks for a plane drawing where the
        number of edge crossings is minimum. Indeed, if we are allowed to visualize
        only one drawing, then the one which minimizes the number of crossings is
        probably the neatest for the first orientation. However, a collection of drawings
        where each highlights a different aspect of a graph without any crossings
        could shed even more light on the graph''s structure. We propose two definitions.
        First, the uncrossed number, minimizes the number of graph drawings in a collection,
        satisfying the uncrossed property. Second, the uncrossed crossing number,
        minimizes the total number of crossings in the collection that satisfy the
        uncrossed property. For both definitions, we establish initial results. We

        how the structure of a digraph affects its dichromatic number and to extend
        various results on undirected colouring to digraphs. In the first part of
        this thesis, we examine how the dichromatic number interacts with other metrics.
        First, we consider the degree, which is the maximum number of neighbours of
        a vertex. In the undirected case, this corresponds to Brooks'' theorem, a
        celebrated theorem with multiple variations and generalizations. In the directed
        case, there is no natural metric corresponding to the maximum degree, so we
        explore how different notions of maximum directed degree lead to either Brooks-like
        theorems or impossibility results. We also investigate the maximum local-arc
        connectivity, a metric that encompasses several degree-like metrics. The second
        part of this manuscript focuses on a directed analogue of the Gy\\''arf\\''as-Sumner
        conjecture. The Gy\\''arf\\''as-Sumner conjecture tries to characterize sets
        S of undirected graphs such that graphs with large enough chromatic number
        must contain a graph of S. This conjecture is still largely open. On digraphs,
        a corresponding conjecture was proposed by Aboulker, Charbit, and Naserasr.
        We prove several subcases of this conjecture, mainly demonstrating that certain
        classes of digraphs have bounded dichromatic number. In the last part of this
        thesis, we address the d-edge-defective-colouring problem, which involves
        colouring edges of a multigraph such that, for any vertex, no colour appears
        on more than d of its incident edges. When d equals one, this corresponds
        to the infamous edge-colouring problem. Shannon established a tight bound
        on the number of colours needed relative to the maximum degree when d equals
        one, and we extend this result to any value of d. We also explore this problem
        on simple graphs and prove results that extend Vizing''s theorem to any value
        of d.", "venue": "", "year": 2023, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount": 0,

        the readability of planar drawings with the clarity of (non-planar) orthogonal
        drawings. We consider these graphs both with and without bends. Our contribution
        is as follows: (i) We study inclusion relationships between apRAC and traditional
        RAC graphs. (ii) We establish bounds on the edge density of apRAC graphs.
        (iii) We show that every graph with maximum degree 8 is 2-bend apRAC and give

        of a subset of vertices in a large communication network", "abstract": "The
        problems of the proposed paper are generated by the actual tasks of communication
        networks. The development of communication resources is accompanied by an
        increase in the dimension of existing communication networks, for which the
        usual tools for solving network problems are becoming increasingly ineffective.At
        the same time, the spectrum of communication network problems covers both
        classical graph theory problems and specialized problems linking them with
        mathematical models of various fields of mathematics, including optimization
        theory, dynamic programming, probability theory and the theory of heuristic
        algorithms. This paper is devoted to the study of the problem of optimal allocation
        of a certain resource on the objects of the communication network. In this
        case, a complete set of specialized equipment at the nodes of the communication
        network is considered as a resource. It is necessary to optimize the number
        of pieces of equipment with the condition that all fiber-optic communication
        lines of the network are under the control of installed reflectometers. To
        solve this problem, variants of two methods were described: the greedy algorithm
        and the method of branches and boundaries. On the basis of the described algorithms,
        the computer programs were implemented and computational experiments were
        carried out; in the latter, the dimension of the communication network was
        chosen high enough to guarantee the legality of using the selected variants
        of algorithms for real communication networks. A representative series of
        experiments has shown that it is more expedient to use variants of the greedy
        heuristic algorithm for the group of problems under consideration, this paper
        contains a detailed argumentation\nof the result obtained. The considered
        problem can also be transferred to cases of optimal placement of other resources
        on the objects of the communication network. At the same time, if there is
        a specific objective function, there will be another formalization of restrictions.
        But the approaches to choosing the optimum may be identical, which makes the
        results obtained in the paper more important due to their participation in
        potential generalizations of the problem.", "venue": "Cybernetics and Physics",

        "We determine all maximum weight downsets in the product of two chains, where
        the weight function is a strictly increasing function of the rank. Many discrete
        isoperimetric problems can be reduced to the maximum weight downset problem.
        Our results generalize Lindsay''s edge-isoperimetric theorem in two dimensions
        in several directions. They also imply and strengthen (in several directions)
        a result of Ahlswede and Katona concerning graphs with maximal number of adjacent
        pairs of edges. We find all optimal shifted graphs in the Ahlswede-Katona
        problem. Furthermore, the results of Ahlswede-Katona are extended to posets
        with a rank increasing and rank constant weight function. Our results also
        strengthen a special case of a recent result by Keough and Radcliffe concerning
        graphs with the fewest matchings. All of these results are achieved by applications
        of a key lemma that we call the reflect-push method. This method is geometric
        and combinatorial. Most of the literature on edge-isoperimetric inequalities
        focuses on finding a solution, and there are no general methods for finding
        all possible solutions. Our results give a general approach for finding all
        compressed solutions for the above edge-isoperimetric problems. By using the
        Ahlswede-Cai local-global principle, one can conclude that lexicographic solutions
        are optimal for many cases of higher dimensional isoperimetric problems. With
        this and our two dimensional results we can prove Lindsay''s edge-isoperimetric
        inequality in any dimension. Furthermore, our results show that lexicographic
        solutions are the unique solutions for which compression techniques can be
        applied in this general setting.", "venue": "", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

        if it has pairwise distinct vertex degrees. No nontrivial (simple) graph is
        thus irregular. The irregularity strength of a graph $G$, $s(G)$, is a specific
        measure of the ``level of irregularity\u2018\u2018 of $G$. It might be defined
        as the least $k$ such that one may obtain an irregular multigraph of $G$ by
        multiplying any selected edges of $G$, each into at most $k$ its copies. In
        other words, $s(G)$ is the least $k$ admitting a $\\{1,2,\\ldots,k\\}$-weighting
        of the edges of $G$ assuring distinct weighted degrees for all the vertices,

        The most well-known open problem concerning this graph invariant is the conjecture

        "Motivated by different characterizations of planar graphs and the 4-Color
        Theorem, several structural results concerning graphs of high chromatic number
        have been obtained. Toward strengthening some of these results, we consider
        the \\emph{balanced chromatic number}, $\\chi_b(\\hat{G})$, of a signed graph
        $\\hat{G}$. This is the minimum number of parts into which the vertices of
        a signed graph can be partitioned so that none of the parts induces a negative
        cycle. This extends the notion of the chromatic number of a graph since $\\chi(G)=\\chi_b(\\tilde{G})$,
        where $\\tilde{G}$ denotes the signed graph obtained from~$G$ by replacing
        each edge with a pair of (parallel) positive and negative edges. We introduce
        a signed version of Hadwiger''s conjecture as follows. Conjecture: If a signed
        graph $\\hat{G}$ has no negative loop and no $\\tilde{K_t}$-minor, then its
        balanced chromatic number is at most $t-1$. We prove that this conjecture
        is, in fact, equivalent to Hadwiger''s conjecture and show its relation to
        the Odd Hadwiger Conjecture. Motivated by these results, we also consider
        the relation between subdivisions and balanced chromatic number. We prove
        that if $(G, \\sigma)$ has no negative loop and no $\\tilde{K_t}$-subdivision,
        then it admits a balanced $\\frac{79}{2}t^2$-coloring. This qualitatively
        generalizes a result of Kawarabayashi (2013) on totally odd subdivisions.",
