      "abstract": "USAID and micro\ufb01nance institutions use recent evidence to
      shift from traditional micro\ufb01nance to other approaches. In the early 2000s,
      microcredit received extensive praise as a poverty-\ufb01ghting tool, while
      critics claimed it indebted poor households. At the time, however, little rigorous
      evidence existed on its impacts. Six randomized evaluations, led by IPA-and
      J-PAL a\ufb03liates, found that microcredit had some bene\ufb01ts, such as expanding
      business activity, but did not reduce poverty or lead to empowerment for women
      on average. Nor were the loans harmful. In 2018, the U.S. Agency for International
      Development cited this research, along with other IPA studies, in its decision
      to shift from traditional micro\ufb01nance to the Graduation Approach and building
      more inclusive markets. The evidence also contributed to a shift in public opinion
      and helped propel the micro\ufb01nance industry in new directions to expand
      \ufb01nancial access to the extreme poor.", "venue": "", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

      a systematic analysis of recent political developments in this area. Additionally,
      our analysis leads to the questioning of some basic premises of the external
      incentives model. Most notably in this specific case we find that credible EU
      commitment, rather than low adoption costs and weak veto players, has constituted
      a necessary and sufficient condition for the reform process. Likewise, we find
      a dynamic relationship between EU induced democratic reforms and adoption costs

      In contrast, co-donations increase in the default amount. We complement our

      creating an opportunity to close debate with a simple majority vote after a
      sufficiently long floor debate, making it more onerous for the minority to sustain
      filibusters, and outright abolishing the filibuster. In each of these cases,

      To study whether there are corresponding differences in social preferences,
      we conducted a large-scale international social preference experiment where
      Americans and Norwegians make distributive choices in identical environments.

      question of whether the Canadian Senate should be abolished or reformed since
      1980, yet a solution has still not been found. While some advocate for a substantial
      reform of the institution, others propose to get rid of it completely. Drawing
      from the 2021 Canadian Election Study, this article explores the underlying
      value systems that shape opinions on the abolition of the Canadian Senate. The
      findings suggest that support for the abolition of the Canadian Senate should
      be understood as part of a set of populist attitudes, the extent of political

      workplace location, despite there being no direct evidence of it in the data
      supplied to researchers. We link surveys to examine the hypothesis that employees

      to have their work location incorrectly recorded as the respondent fails to
      correct the work location variable that has been pre-filled. In the short-term,
      suggestions are made to improve the quality of ASHE microdata, while longer-term
      we suggest that the burden of collecting additional data could be offset through
      greater use of electronic data capture. More generally, in a time when statistical

      leading multidisciplinary journal in the field of international trade broadly
      defined. In the period during which Alan was editor of the journal, the number
      of issues grew from three to five, reflecting the significant increase in the
      number of quality submissions. The impact factor of the journal rose to 1.6
      in 2020, an increase by 150%, above that of The World Economy, arguably the
      incumbent in the field when the WTR was created.", "venue": "World Trade Review",

      Review of Articles", "abstract": "Introduction In the midst of the COVID-19
      crisis, it might be difficult to provide the most vulnerable people with access
      to essential services. The main objective of this article is to lay the foundation
      for future solutions by collecting the results of previous published articles.
      Methods This study used a systematic and integrated method that began by searching
      relevant literature in professional and generally published journal databases
      from March 2019- December 2021. Results According to the results of the review,
      COVID-19 has had a significant effect on real and forecasted key macroeconomic
      variables such as economic growth, unemployment, inflation, poverty levels,
      and fiscal and monetary policy. In addition, this review reflects the sectorial
      effect of COVID-19 on health, factor productivity, domestic trade, exports,
      tourism, international aviation, remittances, the education sector, foreign
      direct investment, and the Ethiopian economy. Conclusion While appropriate social
      distance and personal protective equipment strategies exist in all types of
      markets across the country, the government should take precautions against the
      recurrence of Covid-19 by disseminating credible information. Finally, fiscal
      optimization should be seen as a broader intervention in the economy as a whole.",

      "title": "Is Training More Frequent When the Wage Premium Is Smaller", "abstract":
      "According to Becker [1964], when labour markets are perfectly competitive,
      general training is paid by the worker, who reaps all the benefits from the
      investment. Therefore, ceteris paribus, the greater the training wage premium,
      the greater the investment in general training. Using data from the European
      Community Household Panel, we compute a proxy of the training wage premium in
      clusters of homogeneous workers and find that smaller premia induce greater
      incidence of off-site training, which is likely to impart general skills. Our
      findings suggest that the Becker model provides insufficient guidance to understand
      empirical training patterns. Conversely, they are not inconsistent with theories
      of training in imperfectly competitive labour markets, in which firms may be
      willing to finance general training if the wage structure is compressed, that
      is, if the increase in productivity after training is greater than the increase
      in pay.", "venue": "", "year": 2006, "referenceCount": 68, "citationCount":
