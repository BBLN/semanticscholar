        "abstract": "Most Difference-in-Difference (DD) papers rely on many years
        of data and focus on serially correlated outcomes. Yet almost all these papers
        ignore the bias in the estimated standard errors that serial correlation introduce4s.
        This is especially troubling because the independent variable of interest
        in DD estimation (e.g., the passage of law) is itself very serially correlated,
        which will exacerbate the bias in standard errors. To illustrate the severity
        of this issue, we randomly generate placebo laws in state-level data on female
        wages from the Current Population Survey. For each law, we use OLS to compute
        the DD estimate of its ''effect'' as well as the standard error for this estimate.
        The standard errors are severely biased: with about 20 years of data, DD estimation
        finds an ''effect'' significant at the 5% level of up to 45% of the placebo
        laws. Two very simple techniques can solve this problem for large sample sizes.
        The first technique consists in collapsing the data and ignoring the time-series
        variation altogether; the second technique is to estimate standard errors
        while allowing for an arbitrary covariance structure between time periods.
        We also suggest a third technique, based on randomization inference testing
        methods, which works well irrespective of sample size. This technique uses
        the empirical distribution of estimated effects for placebo laws to form the
        test distribution.", "venue": "", "year": 2001, "referenceCount": 30, "citationCount":
